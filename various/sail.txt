Foreword  
I met Andy when he came to help out my preparations on Ocean Planet for  the 2004-2005 Vendee Globe. A nice guy and good sense of humor; after all  he's Canadian.  
In many ways he represents all those who have become successful solo  sailors on their own nickel; learning slowly from a mix of hard-earned  experience, digging up obscure info, and sharing with each other.  
It's not like this sort of experience is falling off trees. While a lot of jabber  about singlehanded sailing can be found on discussion forums and the odd  magazine articles, this is the first collection of the varied aspects of the sport  put together in one place. It takes thousands of hours of sailing to get the  kind of knowledge contained in this book. It also takes a lot of  experimentation and a willingness to be wrong nine times before getting it  right on the tenth.  
There are many recipes for successful solo sailing; as many as the actual  sailors who do it. And there are many different levels of personal  priorities. However many, many of the same mistakes are made over and  over by those new to the sport, and by those who simply think they have it  already figured out. Most of those mistakes can be prevented by carefully  analyzing what Andy has put together.  
This is good stuff, and I'm especially glad that he did it, because now I don't  have to.  
Cheers,  
Bruce Schwab

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

If I was the richest man in the world,  I’d have a bigger boat and newer sails.  But on a Saturday afternoon with only  God and the wind, I wouldn’t be any  happier than I am right now.  
Over the past ten years I’ve gone singlehanded  sailing more than eight hundred times. I started  just four days after getting my first boat and have  rarely looked back. Included in this are more  than 250 individual races. In total, it adds up to  perhaps 3,500 hours of singlehanded sailing – a  reasonable start.  
With all of these times that I have left the dock, I  have never – not even once – had a bad day on  the water. I’ve had days when things went  wrong; difficult things, expensive things. I’ve  had days when the wind blew more than most  could handle, and I’ve had days when it didn’t  blow at all. But I have never had a day that  didn’t live up to its full potential, when I wished  I had been somewhere else. I am certain that  very few sailors in the world can make the same  claim.  
Sailing gives me a sense of joy that is quite rare.  I imagine it is the same sense that the monks in  Tibet achieve. It is certainly the sense that the  Dalai Lama seems to show every time he laughs.  
But not all sailing gives me this feeling, only  single-handing. I have raced many times with a  full crew, but found myself frustrated more often  than not. Why is this? I’ve had some great  crewmates; friendly people who were fantastic to  spend time with. Perhaps I found it too  exhausting, as skipper, to be responsible for not  only my own actions, but the actions of every  other person on the boat.  
When I’m alone, I rarely need to consider what  I’m doing. The boat just reacts to my desires -  automatically. One day I was sailing alongside  
another yacht and the skipper told me that I  “wear my boat like a glove.” So I guess it could  be said that for me, sailing alone is like putting  
on a comfortable body suit that reacts to my  every whim; but sailing with a crew is like  wearing a suit of armor, where every move must  be considered, communicated, then performed.  It’s just too much work.  
I do know that if singlehanded sailing was not  possible, I wouldn’t sail at all; I’d take up  some other hobby – perhaps jigsaw puzzles.  
With this number of trips under my keel, it is  reasonable to guess that I am one of the more  experienced singlehanded sailors in the world.  Not in miles, but certainly in number of times  I’ve left the dock, number of tacks, number of  
gybes, spinnaker launches and douses, and  number of learning experiences.  
By nature, I have a real interest in efficiency. I  have always tried to find the best, most efficient  way to perform any task. Over the past decade I  have looked at every aspect of singlehanded  sailing and tried to find the best way to do it on  my boat. This compulsion gets right down to the  how long should I pause during a tack to do the  least work hauling in the sheets, and it even  includes a detailed plan on how to urinate. I’ve  taken every action down to a precise science.  
I am also not at all shy about asking questions of  other sailors. I get some funny looks at the bar  and some nasty comments on the forums, but I  would rather look stupid and learn, than look  smart and remain stupid. When I speak to other  skippers, I don’t just ask “do you use a  spinnaker?” I ask, “Tell me the exact steps you  take to pull the halyard, guy and sheet to raise  the spinnaker without fouling it?” My Olson 30  is named Foolish Muse, and my forum name is  Foolish. Some have pointed out that this seems  appropriate.  
This book is the result of an almost “academic”  study of the techniques of singlehanded sailing.  It is also the result of trial and an incredible  number of errors. For the first eight years of  sailing, I can confidently say that something 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 1 - 1  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

went wrong every time I went out – every single  time. It got to the point where if I was returning  to the dock and something bad had not happened  yet, I knew that it still would happen. I have  
always pushed my boat and myself to the limit.  Of course things will go wrong when pushed.  
Every time something went wrong, I took it as a  learning experience. Most times it took making  the same mistake over and over again before I  figured out a better way. I can give an example  of raising the spinnaker. I’d had too many  broaches to count before finally figuring out the  perfect method. Because of these I know exactly  how far the water will come into my cockpit on a  broach and no longer have any fear, or even  concern, about broaching. But since the day that  I figured it out, I have not had a single broach in  any wind conditions.  
But I am not finished. That things have stopped  going wrong over the past year is only an  indication that I need a faster boat to start the  learning process again.  
The purpose of this book is to impart these  many, many lessons to the reader in the form of  tips, techniques and tactics. In some cases I will  go into a painful level of detail. My intention is  that a new singlehander should not have to go  through the trial and error phase that I followed.  If he or she can learn from my mistakes before  they leave the dock, they can push their boat  further and create their own, new mistakes.  After reading this book, and with perhaps one or  two thousand hours of practice, every sailor  should be able to wear their boat like a glove.  
This book has been downloaded about twenty  thousand times so for, and a Google search finds  more links that I could ever have imagined.  Parts of it have been translated into a dozen  languages, some of which I don’t recognize at  all. An attempt is even being made to translate  the whole thing into Polish! I’ve received  messages and contributions from all over the  world. Thank you very much.

autographed posters of Dame Ellen MacArthur  and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston. (It seems that of  any activity in the world, singlehanded sailors  have the best odds of being Knighted.)  
My greatest admiration goes to everyone who  left the dock on their own, personal voyage.  Some of these skippers have met their goals,  while others have not. One circumnavigator  stayed at sea for over 1,000 days, while another  ended her voyage after just a week. But they  have all been successful in undertaking a  significant life adventure. They all have stories  to tell and they are all worthy of our admiration.  Offshore singlehanded sailing is a challenge  taken by less than one out of every ten million  people in the world. In our over protective  society, it is one of the few activities where an  individual is responsible for his own safety. For  this reason alone, every singlehanded sailor  made it onto my hero list the moment they left  the dock.  
My dream started back in 1989 when I read John  Hughes “The Sailing Spirit” about the BOC  Challenge (forerunner of the Around Alone and  5 Oceans.) I followed the races very carefully in  a time before the internet, when the only news  was a recorded voice over an expensive long  distance telephone call. I plotted the positions  with coloured lines on a world map. Eleven years  later I said to my wife, “If I’m going to sail  around the world, I’d better get a boat,” and this  adventure began.

By profession I am a lawyer and Chartered  Financial Analyst, but mostly I am President of a  small company in the solar power industry. I  live in Victoria, on the west coast of Canada and  sail out of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club. I am  blessed that this is the only region of a cold  country where I can sail year round.  
Sextant Users Guide:  
A few years ago, Santa gave me a new sextant  for Christmas. I borrowed five books from the  library, but was more confused than ever. They  all go into a level of mathematical complexity  that is well beyond my understanding, and they  all assume that I am on the deck of an aircraft  carrier, not bucking the waves on a 30’ sailboat  with the tiller under my knee. I got fed up and  determined that the only way to learn the darned  thing was to write my own guide. It can be  downloaded at:

Here is a quote from Jerry Freeman, from the  Solo Offshore Racing Club website  
(www.offshoresolo.com)  
For most of us normal yachties  the prospect of spending 20 to 30  nights alone at sea is so far off  the scale as to be impossible to  contemplate. A recent gathering  of singlehanders provided an  ideal opportunity to study these  rare creatures in their natural  habitat before they dispersed for  their hibernation.  
Is it a macho thing, this solo  ocean racing? If so why is it  that two of the biggest boats  were sailed by the two most  petite lady skippers? They will  claim that solo yacht racing is a  cerebral sport like chess; brawn  is not required and if it is you  must be doing something wrong so  have a nap and try again. What  other sport is there where the  contestants out-sleep each other?  
From this group, it seems the  overriding qualification for solo  sailing is advanced age, being a  paid up member of the ‘Last  Chance’ brigade. Time is running  out as the years of procras tination accumulate towards a  crisis. Grandpa, casting off the  responsible years of family and  school fees, enjoys a financial  second wind. The prospect of  dying and not knowing becomes  more scary than the prospect of  going. 
The legend of the oldest race  goes back to 1960 when men were  made of sterner stuff and by gum  they had to be. That’s the  trouble with young people, no  respect, they just toddle across  the Atlantic like it was a Sunday  school outing. Where is the  drama, the passion, how are they  going to get a book deal out of  21 days and no problems?  
 The art of tuning a cat’s whisker  on the wireless has been lost in  the mists of time as the Iridium

There’s not even  Test Match cricket on short wave  of the BBC World Service to  endure, all gone!

celebrate a good day’s run? You  can forget that. We are all  athletes now.  
Numerous reviews have been written about this  book. Here is my favorite, from The Watchorn:  
This month I’d like to switch gears and  get a little philosophical with you  about boating. I was recently reading  a lengthy article titled “Singlehanded  Tips,” written by Andrew Evans, who has  logged more than 3,000 hours of  singlehanded sailing in the last ten  years. The article is a great read  that runs for 147 pages. I highly  recommend it to anyone interested in  the mental and physical affects that  singlehanded sailing can have on an  individual, or for those who are toying  with the idea of rigging your vessel  for singlehanded operation.  
 The subject that interests me most in  this article is the underlying desire  for these eccentric boaters to try  singlehanded sailing in the first  place. Yes, at times everyone has a  reason for taking their boat out by  themselves and partaking in a little  solo cruise, but this type of sailing  is a far cry from bashing through  fifteen foot seas with a triple reef in  the main and sixty knot winds trying to  knock the boat over on her ear. And to  do this by yourself, with no one there  to relieve you at the wheel or to make  you a hot  
cup of  
coffee when  
you are  
tired, must  
require a  
hearty  
individual  
indeed. If  
these men  
and women  
weren’t  
finding  
their  
thrills  
sailing  
they would  
probably be  
getting  
them by  
fighting  
the Taliban in Afghanistan, base jumping off of cliffs or, even more  terrifying, trying to eat my  
girlfriend’s meatloaf without making a  funny face. (To be fair, she is a  
vegetarian. Trying to get her to cook  meat is like asking a blind man to  describe a rainbow.) I guess some  people see a mountain and just have to  climb it.  
I wonder if some people have a natural  inclination towards danger. Certainly  the idea goes against Darwin’s  thoughts; natural selection does not  favor those who stick their necks too  far into the fire. And yet I have  known too many people who simply must  do something dangerous in order to  truly feel alive. Is this rush of  adrenaline really worth the chance of  perishing in Arctic waters during a  heavy storm? Being the polar opposite  of these adrenaline junkies, I guess I  really cannot say. I can tell you I’m  jealous every time I read literature  like the aforementioned article, and  can’t help but daydream of what it must  truly be like to fight tooth and nail  for every second of survival. I can  also tell you that it simply must be  better to feel those fleeting moments  of danger and survive them than to have  never felt them at all. Andrew Evans,  I salute you.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Ch. 2: The Mental Challenge:  
Many sailors consider “shorthanded sailing” to  be comparable to “singlehanded sailing.” In my  view, having two people on the boat is no  different from having eight. The reason is not  because of the physical challenges. The reasons  are entirely because of the mental and emotional  challenges facing a singlehander that the crew of  a double handed or fully crewed boat will never  see. Mental challenges occur during even the  shortest trips. Emotional challenges can appear  on trips as short as eight hours, but more likely  after 12 hours or a day.  
The internet has become the best resource to  prove this point. Skippers in round the world  races are posting daily video to the web. These  videos show sailors who are physically, mentally  and emotionally exhausted from days without  adequate sleep. It is obvious that they are  working with significantly less than full mental  faculties. The pictures are completely different  from double handed or crewed boats, where  sleep is possible. Solo sailors are forced into  complex decision making processes at the very  time when they are least able to perform.  
Quoting from Ellen MacArthur’s incredible story  in “Taking on the World:”  
“It was more than just physical  exhaustion; it was causing more  pain inside than I had ever felt  before. I clenched my teeth and  threw my head down against the  hard, wet floor and wept. I  cried like a baby till I was so  numb with the cold that the pain  was dulled. Shivering and weak,  I crawled into the cabin and  slept in my waterproofs, curled  up in a ball in the footwell by  the engine.”  
From John Hughes’ “The Sailing Spirit:”  “The tears ran unabated down my  face as I watch Turtles, the boat  carrying my girlfriend, Vick, my  mother, and my close friends turn  
and scuttle back to the shelter  of Newport harbour. The image  of that parting will never leave  me. It came almost two hours  after the starting gun was fired  to signal the start of the BOC  race, two hours of beating to  windward that had left me  physically and emotionally  exhausted.”  
From the Singlehanded Transpac logs:  “Last thought for now: it is so  beautiful out here, I am finding  myself crying over every happy  memory I have with family and  friends. I don’t know why that’s  going on.”  
Another Transpac memory:  
“I spent two solid hours bawling  half way to Hawaii. Every sad  possibility crossed my mind.  “What was in the half-way package  that my wife gave me? Was it a  note that she was leaving me?  Was it a note that she was  dieing?” I knew that these were  both incredibly ridiculous  concepts, but I’d been alone for  more than a week with very little  sleep and no contact from home,  emotions can run wild.”  
From Adam Mayers’ “Sea of Dreams:”  “John Dennis turned fifty-eight  on the fleet’s third day back at  sea after the Bay of Biscay  storm. The boyish glee he’d felt  on leaving Newport was long gone  and he felt old, tired,  
depressed, and guilty about the  toll the trip was taking on his  family, something he had not  fully considered before he set  sail. He had expected to miss  them, but had not expected the  pangs of loneliness to outweigh  the pleasure of the journey.  Phone calls and e-mails became  painful stews of anticipation and  regret.” 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 1  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

In a later chapter, when Dennis is forced to retire  from mechanical problems, Mayers continues:  “It was over; John Dennis was not  going to sail around the world.  “I’m so drained, I don’t have any  tears left”, he said, “It is a  dream and I know now I am never  going to achieve it. I’m  devastated.”  
As far as I know, singlehanded sailing is the only  sport where one needs to be physically, mentally  and emotionally ready, just to finish. I have  read many books on sailing the great races. I  have never read that the skipper of a Volvo  Ocean Race boat broke down and cried. It just  does not happen on a crewed boat. This is the  difference between singlehanding and crewing,  even with just two on board.  
Consider how rare it is in modern society for  someone to be totally alone and totally self  reliant. This does not mean reading a book with  a family member in the next room. This does  not mean sitting with a telephone or computer  nearby, ready to electronically communicate.  Being totally alone means the sailor must rely  completely on his own abilities with no recourse  to any assistance from any other person.  
Some might counter that with radio, cell phone  or satellite phone a singlehander is never alone  and can always call for assistance. This is true in  the long term, but has no standing for the  hundreds of things that do go awry and require  immediate resolution. A VHF serves no purpose  when a boat is broached and the cockpit is half  full of water. A cell phone won’t help with  strong winds and a lee shore. A single side band  radio cannot unwrap a spinnaker.  
In one race with a 20 knot wind, I wrapped my  spinnaker around the forestay attempting a gybe.  I was about 3 minutes from the rocks, but  because of the spinnaker half out, could not turn  up. I went to the bow and got the chute down  with about 30 seconds to spare. After the race,  the skipper of a crewed boat told me that they  
were just about to come to my aid when I got the  mess sorted. I could only ask him “What were  you going to do?” My actions alone were the  only possible source of a solution to the problem.  If I couldn’t do it, the boat was lost.  
The singlehanded sailor must understand that he  is completely, 100% self reliant. It is up to him  alone to solve every situation that he faces,  whether it be a simple knotted line or a life  threatening danger. I believe that this is why we  are rare. One only needs to look at a single/  double handed race, regardless of it being a two  hour club event or a professional around the  world adventure. There will be ten double  handed boats for every singlehander. The reason  is not that the double handers are physically  incapable of sailing their boat alone. The reason  is that only the singlehanders are willing to take  on the challenge of 100% self reliance. This can  be a very uncomfortable position. It is such a  rare situation that most people will never face it.  
Stress and Coping  
Several studies have concentrated on the specific  stresses of long distance, singlehanded sailing.  
“Medical and psychological problems in the  1972 singlehanded transatlantic yacht race” Glin  Bennet, The Lancet 2, 1973.  
Bennet performed an in-depth, real time study of  thirty-four competitors in the Observer  Transatlantic race. Each competitor was  designated by a letter A-Z.  
Sailing in general is an  
exhilarating activity most of the  time. However, when a man has to  spend hours on end at the helm,  is cold, soaked through, seasick,  hungry, uncertain about his  ability to handle the boat in all  conditions, and does not know his  position, he is liable to make  mistakes observing lights and  landmarks, reading his charts,  and planning rational courses of

action. This is borne out by  numerous personal accounts  reported to me, and is in line  with experimental work on the  effects of fatigue on  
performance.  
Visual Experiences:  
R reported on day 10: “Spots…  before.. my eyes when looking at  the sky. I feel my tactics in  staying south and east so long  may have backfired with this  weather and more or less put me  out of the competitive race.” He  was sleeping adequately but  feeling tense and physically  uncomfortable. On day 26 “spots  before my eyes again. Not  serious and only occasional… I  think I’ve been spoiled by all  that calm weather. Conditions  have not been all that rough but  I’m really exhausted”.  
Day 35: “usual spots before eyes  when tired. Three days of gales  and storms. Very miserable.  Poor progress.” He had little  sleep during this period, made  errors in navigation and sail  handling: a tape recording made  at the time records his distress  and despair in the most poignant  fashion.  
T was setting his twin foresails  for the first time in the race at  about noon on day 33 in good  visibility when he saw an object  in the water. “A baby elephant”,  he thought: “A funny place to put  a baby elephant.” A little  later, looking at the same  object: “A funny place to put a  Ford Popular.” He accepted these  observations without question  until on closer inspection he  realized that the object was a  whale. This occurred 3 days  before arrival, and he was  feeling alert, only trying out a  maneuver for the first time.

experiences were reported in the  qualifying trip. K had been  continuously at the helm for 56  hours because of bad conditions,  and was making do with only  occasional snacks. He saw his  father-in-law at the top of the  mast. They were aware of one  another’s presence, and the  experience was in no way  
alarming.  
Sailing his 52ft trimaran up from  the Bay of Biscay around Ushant,  A could not put into any harbour  west of St. Malo, and because of  the treacherous coast and the  shipping he could get little  rest. Further he had only 1  day’s food remaining, to last for  6 days. He was lying on his bunk  when he heard a man putting the  boat about on to the other tack.  He had “seen” nothing at that  point, but when he went up on  deck to investigate the man  passed him in the passageway  coming down as he went up. The  boat had indeed been put about  and was on the correct course.  
Amongst singlehanders the  difference between sleeping and  waking was often blurred even  when apparently well rested, so  what was a premonition while  awake and what was a dream  dreamed in sleep was hard to  diminish.  
What is striking is the frequency  and range of the psychological  phenomena reported. Taken out  of context they might be said to  provide evidence of severe mental  disorder, but what is their  significance in context? Is  there something special about the  business of singlehanded sailing  that makes such phenomena common,  or are they due to some  
peculiarity in the sailors  themselves?

Experimental work on sensory  deprivation and sleep deprivation  shows that gross disorders of  perception and thinking processes  can be produced quite reliably.  Further, these reactions are more  likely if the subject is fatigued  or anxious. The sustained  exposure to the elements, the  seasickness, and lack of  
nourishment certainly contribute  to the development of fatigue.  Sensory deprivation also  
occurred, but mainly in the form  of seduced patterning. The whine  of wind in the rigging, the  steady noise of the waves, the  lack of anything on the surface  of the sea or in the sky,  especially in foggy conditions,  all reduce the sensory input and  increase the likelihood of the  development of visual and  auditory experience from within.  
Published accounts of perceptual  disturbances which would lead the  subject to disaster suggest that  insight generally prevents total  destruction. For instance, a  very weary sailor on another  occasion was close to the Belgian  coast and saw two men on the  shore beckoning him and pointing  to the harbour entrance. He did  not go in for some reason but  anchored offshore. In the  morning he woke after a long  sleep to find only rocks along  that stretch of coast. On the  other hand one is not likely to  have many records from the very  fatigued whose insight was  totally suspended.  
It is hoped that those who have  to maintain a high level of  function in adverse physical  conditions will come to recognize  the subtle ways fatigue can place  them at risk and take measures to  protect themselves.  
Hallucinations are fairly common among  singlehanders. This is a predictable byproduct of  lack of sleep and an unfamiliar environment.  During the Singlehanded Transpac, I climbed on  deck in the middle of the night to find three men  crouched at the bow as I sailed down a river in  Germany. They were ignoring my commands.  After a couple of minutes I sat down in the  cockpit and realized that something was wrong.  I gained hold of my senses and thought “wow,  that must be an hallucination.”  
In the 2002 Transpac, Mark Deppe reported:  
I had my first set of lucid  dreams in awhile last night. A  lucid dream is unlike any normal  kind of dream. It is so vivid and  detailed that it is very close to  being awake. But the most  interesting aspect is that the  dreamer is aware that he is  dreaming, and can control how the  dream develops.  
I've only experienced lucid  dreams a handful of times, and  most always on a boat or ship  after a week or so. In my case,  being extremely fatigued helps  initiate the special conditions  required to enter the lucid  state, since you must remain  aware of the fact you are  dreaming without actually waking  up. It's a very fine line. The  dream rivals reality in how  detailed and lifelike it is. My  favorite thing to do while lucid  dreaming is to fly. Since I can  control any aspect of the dream,  I can move my body about freely  without any of the normal  constraints of gravity. Fun  stuff.  
Hearing Voices: While crossing the Pacific, I  heard distinct voices inside the boat. It sounded  like a group of people having a conversation in a  foreign language, as if over a radio broadcast. I  have never had this experience with short

voyages, so it is not simply because of water on  the hull. Fatigue must play a roll.  
This is a very common phenomena on long  distance voyages, as indicated by Mark Deppe  aboard the J-120 Alchera in the 2008 Transpac  logs:  
I've started hearing voices  again. Seems to happen every  Transpac at some point. I could  swear there's a radio with a talk  show tuned in located somewhere  in the forward berth under the  spinnaker I have spread out  drying from the last dunking it  took. And in the sound of the  water going by outside the hull I  hear what sounds like party  conversations going on very  faintly.  
In 2002 Mark reported:  
Got to go, it sounds like there's  an argument going on in the  forward berth, and someone else  is knocking on the outside of the  hull for attention. There's  another voice that keeps saying  'Got Milk?' 'Got Milk?' over and  over again, I wish it would get  it's milk and shut up.  
Al Hughes on the Open 60 Dogbark reported the  same:  
Dogbark has had a relatively slow  trip for her so far but the  skipper is showing signs of  cracking. I remember this from  the first trip, I start hearing  things, like a radio playing or  voices in the background. After a  while you can start talking to  them, strange but true. I guess  it is a little bit of sleep  deprivation, near constant stress  and limited contact with others,  sound like the solo sailors  lament or dream depending.  
I know of one skipper who searched his boat for  stowaways during the 2006 Transpac.  
“Psychological breakdown at sea: hazards of  singlehanded ocean sailing,” Glin Bennet,  British Journal of medical Psychology, 47, 1974.  In his second study, Bennet carefully analyzed  the stresses faced by Donald Crowhurst in his ill  fated attempt at the first round the world race,  based on the research in the book “The Strange  Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst” by Nicholas  Tomalin and Ron Hall: 1970.  
“It is perhaps the most  
completely documented account of  a psychological breakdown.”  
His speculative writings begin  proper off the southern part of  South America while he is waiting  to “re-enter” the race. He  becomes aware of the tremendous  reception awaiting him, the  B.B.C. coming out to meet him,  and he finally retreats from  reality altogether. Until the  last few days of course he is  sailing his boat competently and  navigating with adequate  
precision, and later when he was  apparently totally preoccupied  with his thoughts he was able to  send messages in morse concerning  his arrival home. These are all  relatively complex tasks which  one might not expect of someone  as detached from reality as  presumably Crowhurst was. Or  does it mean that someone  apparently absorbed with their  own thoughts does have a greater  ability to switch back into  contact than is generally  supposed?  
On the whole, the evidence points  to a breakdown in the face of an  utterly impossible situation: a  tumultuous homecoming with  national television and radio  coverage as the winner of a  unique contest, through a  deception that was certain to be  discovered. The disgrace would  be bigger enough for anyone to  bear, but for Donald Crowhurst 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 5

this was to have been the  triumphal moment of a life that  until now had been marked by many  false starts and failures. This  success had possibly been  achieved in his mind from the  moment he first thought of  circumnavigation. The realities  of the voyage had proved too much  for him, and when after the first  fortnight of the voyage success  seemed to be slipping out of  reach, he began to manipulate he  realities until he had adjusted  the world to match his  
requirements. Then in his mind  he gained mastery over the world,  over the universe, over god,  until there was no longer any  point in remaining in the world  which most people regard as real.  
One of the functions of tragedy  in the theatre is to present an  intensified view of ordinary  life. With the story of Donald  Crowhurst we have such a story  but, alas, one that is true. The  crisis and the breakdown occurred  on the high seas, but the steps  which led to it in the first  place and the remorseless way in  which he became more firmly  caught in the trap are clearly  discernible, and the parallels  with ordinary life are not hard  to find. Individuals will make  their own interpretations, but  one powerful message that comes  through from this story is the  need to provide those in distress  with the opportunity to express  their real feelings when all  around them the barriers are  going up and the avenues of  escape are closing. 
Read the 2nd half of the last paragraph one more  time, just to absorb it again.  
I strongly recommend that every singlehander  read “The Strange Last Voyage of Donald  Crowhurst” AND “The Long Way” by Bernard  
Moitessier. I have never seen an instance where  the line between genius and insanity was so fine.  
“Voluntary Solitude: Studies of men in a  singlehanded Transatlantic sailing race”, H.E.  Lewis, J.M. Harris, D.H. Lewis, C.  
deMonchhaux, The Lancet 1, 1964  
This was a detailed real time study of the  participants in a 1960 race from Plymouth,  England to New York, USA.  
 The men have certain features of  reported mood pattern in common.  On the whole they tended  
consistently to be calm and  relaxed rather than irritable and  excitable, to feel keen to do  well rather than regretful at  having started, and to be  confident rather than scared.  
There is even more resemblance  among the men in the pattern of  interrelation between their moods  than there is in the mood profile  itself. Thus the positively  toned emotions tended  
consistently to occur together,  and likewise the negatively toned  ones. Calmness, relaxation,  self-sufficiency, keenness,  confidence and physical freshness  were closely related to each  other in all the records, and  conversely excitability,  
irritability, tension, boredom,  loneliness, exhaustion and fear  waxed and waned together.

All skippers stated that poor  yacht performance as a result of  light winds was one of the most  difficult stressors to deal with.  Although much of the respon sibility for the poor progress  lay outside their control,  skippers would spend a lot of  time and energy trying to find  wind and get the yacht moving.  These efforts would subsequently  result in less sleep, greater  physical exhaustion, emotional  instability.  
As discussed above, singlehanders do not face  their greatest stress in storms, but rather in  calms. I believe that this study is applicable:  David Maister, “The psychology of waiting  lines” 1985  
Uncertain Waits Are Longer than  Known, Finite Waits: The most  profound source of anxiety in  waiting is how long the wait will  be. For example, if a patient in  a waiting room is told that the  doctor will be delayed thirty  minutes, he experiences an  initial annoyance but then  relaxes into an acceptance of the  inevitability of the wait.  However, if the patient is told  the doctor will be free soon, he  spends the whole time in a state  of nervous anticipation, unable  to settle down, afraid to depart  and come back. The patient’s  expectations are being managed  poorly.  
A good example of the role of  uncertainty in the waiting  experience is provided by the  “appointment syndrome.” Clients  who arrive early for an  
appointment will sit contentedly  until the scheduled time, even if  this is a significant amount of  time in an absolute sense (say,  thirty minutes). However, once  the appointment time is passed,  even a short wait of, say, ten  
minutes, grows increasingly  annoying. The wait until the  appointed time is finite; waiting  beyond the point has no knowable  limit.  
Solo Waits Feel Longer than Group  Waits: One of the remarkable  syndromes to observe in waiting  lines is to see individuals  sitting or standing next to each  other without talking or  
otherwise interacting until an  announcement of a delay is made.  Then the individuals suddenly  turn to each other to express  their exasperation, wonder  collectively what is happening,  and console each other. What this  illustrates is that there is some  form of comfort in group waiting  rather than waiting alone.  
The most successful predator  introduced to hunt down  
unproductive and anxiety producing wait times has been the  Blackberry. Aptly dubbed the  "Crackberry" by some, this device  lets people be productive in the  most naturally unproductive  locations, like waiting in line.  I guess this would apply to text  messaging on phones or other  things that can be done silently  in lines.  
The above studies prove that calms of  indeterminate length cause the greatest stress to  singlehanders. With a crew there are others to  talk and joke with. By oneself there is nothing  that can be done to improve the situation. A  simple, inexpensive handheld video game might  be the best solution to this problem. A small  game of Tetris will keep one occupied for hours.  
Weston provided the following as stress coping  mechanisms from their study:  
Using social support (e.g., team,  family, friends, supporters,  organizers) enabled skippers to  deal with the difficult 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 7  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

environmental conditions,  isolation, and possible threat  stressors. Anshel (1996)  suggested that such emotion focused coping approaches are  more likely under low perceived  controllability situations.  Nevertheless, although the  present findings provide partial  support for this assertion, the  skippers also employed other  problem – (e.g., staying calm),  appraisal – (e.g. rationalizing  the situation), and approach –  focusing efforts on controllable  factors) focused coping to deal  with these uncontrollable  environmental stressors.  
Boredom: 
Surprisingly, boredom can set in even when  sailing conditions are perfect and the boat is  moving at top speed. I was very bored in the  steady trade winds a few days out of Hawaii.  The boat was steering itself perfectly. There  
were no steps that I could take to increase  performance, so I had nothing to do. During an  afternoon radio chat, one of the other skippers  mirrored my thoughts exactly when he  commented, “I never expected to be so bored.”  
A skipper is advised to bring numerous books on  any voyage. Modern society does not train us  on how to sit still and do nothing. It is much  more difficult than most people desire.  
I have found tremendous relief by listening to  audio books. The website www.librivox.org  contains thousands of classic books in the public  domain and free to download. I will never have  a chance to actually read massive volumes such  as the 1,946 pages in 135 chapters of Moby  Dick. But I was very happy to listen to it over  24 hours, 37 minutes. Another fascinating book  was “The Eventful History of the Mutiny and  Piratical Seizure of H.M.S. Bounty: Its Causes  and Consequences” running ten and a half hours.  Both of these go well beyond anything we have  seen in the movies. Virtually all of the classic  
novels are represented at librivox.org and  skippers will find them welcome friends on long  voyages.  
Emotional Inertia:  
“Fear Paralysis” is a well understood phenomena  where a person is in such fear that they are  unable to move. I know of one sailor who  experienced this during the famous Fastnet  storm. He was so paralyzed that his crew moved  him below, where he simply curled up on the  bunk for the duration of the storm.  
I have developed a different theory that seems to  be applicable to singlehanded sailors or others  who perform dangerous tasks alone. This theory  is based on my own experience and what I have  seen from others. “Emotional inertia” occurs in  a highly stressful situation in unfamiliar  circumstances. The result of the inertia is that  the singlehander continues to actively sail on his  present course and hope for the best, even though  the course will lead to certain doom, rather than  take the potentially dangerous action required to  resolve the situation.  
There are three keys to recognize in this  situation. First is that the singlehander continues  to actively sail the boat, trim the sails and steer  on the present course.  
Second, the present course will lead to certain  doom. That is, there is no question that (at least  in the skipper’s mind) the course will lead to a  very bad, dangerous or even life threatening  situation. Sailing into a rock, loosing the rig, etc.  are perfect examples of this type of situation.  
Third, the skipper is unwilling to take whatever  action is necessary to rectify the situation  because he is afraid of the danger of that action.  He simply “hopes for the best.” In some cases  the required action will be extreme, but in  foresight it is still preferable to the doom faced  on the existing course. Note that I said “in 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 8  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

foresight.” What matters is that the skipper  perceives that doom is certain.  
The best example is a boat heading for rocks in  high winds. The only way to avoid the rocks is  by gybing, but this action will bring the boat  even closer to the rocks before sailing clear. The  skipper must make an immediate choice between  the certainty of hitting the rocks in three minutes,  or gybing and with the potential of hitting the  rocks immediately or hopefully sailing clear.  But the skipper faces emotional inertia. He is  unable to make the choice to gybe, so sails on to  his doom on the rocks.  
I’ve included this concept because if one is  aware of the concept of emotional inertia, he will  be able to avoid it. When facing this type of  dilemma, the skipper should think for a moment  “this must be that emotional inertia problem. I  should snap out of it and do something!”  
I have faced the rocks dilemma twice in my  sailing career. The first time I was unwilling to  gybe and ran on the rocks. After developing the  theory of emotional inertia, the second time I  was aware of the dilemma and did an immediate  gybe and sailed clear.  
As one becomes more skilled, the starting point  for emotional inertia moves further out on the  scale, but it is still in effect. Here are two  examples of highly skilled sailing experts. I  believe that they faced it in what can only be  described as the most extreme circumstances.  
I believe that Derek Hatfield faced emotional  inertia approaching Cape Horn, as described in  the book “Sea Of Dreams,” by Adam Mayers:  As dawn broke on Friday, March 7,  Hatfield saw a red light winking  ahead to his right, about two and  a half miles away. He had been  at the helm for almost twenty four hours and was so exhausted  he could barely think, so he was  not able to comprehend  
immediately what his eyes were  
telling him. As the realization  sank in, fear squeezed the breath  from his lungs. He would later  say this moment was the most  terrifying in his life. “It  still makes me shiver thinking  about it,” he says.  
Hatfield knew he was looking at  the glow of a lighthouse. But if  this was the Horn, the lighthouse  should be on his left, not his  right. If it was the Horn, it  meant he was driving towards  assured destruction, for to the  left there could only be the  jagged shards of volcanic rock.  Driven by hurricane force winds,  he would be dead very quickly,  joining the thousands of others  who had perished here.  
… Over the next fifteen to twenty  minutes, the red circle of light  drew closer as Spirit of Canada  surfed barepoled towards its  fate. The light transfixed  Hatfield, and he wondered whether  these were his last moments on  earth. He tried to change course  and sail towards the light in the  hope that as he got closer he  would be able to see it more  clearly and manoeuvre around it.  But try as he might, he couldn’t  do it. This wind and wave  combination was such that as he  altered his course the waves  threatened to capsize his boat.  When collision seemed certain,  the light slip by and receded  into the night. … He had passed  the Diego Ramirez Islands, a  small chain of rocky outcrops …  thirty miles west of the horn.  
I believe that Pete Goss was facing emotional  inertia, as described in his fantastic book “Close  to the Wind.”  
An hour later the wind suddenly  increased… up to forty knots… I  would never be able to reduce  sail in time – the boat was on  edge and it would be too much to 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 9  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

ask the autopilot. …The front  two thirds of the boat was out of  the water, the bow was up and she  was touching twenty-seven knots  as the gusts swept in from  nowhere….What a prat! I was  trapped by my own stupidity. She  was over canvassed and yet there  was no way I could put the boat  back on autopilot so that I could  go forward and reduce sail. All  I could do was helm and hope for  the best. (Note that I had written the  “hope for the best” line in my emotional inertia  theory prior to reading Goss’s account.) …whatever happened now I must  keep clear of the runner – the  rig was going to go for sure.  
A few hours later Goss’s boat did a Chinese  gybe and broached, pinning the mast to the  water. Luckily the rig survived, but the  spinnaker was destroyed. Continuing the story:  I was determined to make the most  of the experience. As the last  tatter of spinnaker disappeared  into the hatch - £4,500 down the  drain, I decided I wouldn’t be so  stupid again.  
Given the very high probability of loosing the rig  under these conditions (certain doom), it might  have been better to take some other action while  reducing sail in a somewhat orderly manner, but  Goss “hoped for the best.”  
I can only think of a person being led to the  firing squad. Any action, any action at all, is  preferable to this certain doom. Contrary to what  the movies show, there is no dignity in being  shot. When we are alone on a boat, we don’t  even need to consider how an action might look  to others.  
I believe that the problem is less likely on  crewed boats because at least one member of the  crew will step up to make the necessary  suggestion and lead to a decision. It is the type  of situation where the singlehander should slap  himself across the face and “snap out of it!” 
Sleep  
Sleep is one of the most discussed topics in  singlehanding. Most of us can stay awake 24 or  36 hours on a short voyage, but for anything  longer, sleep is a necessity.  
For the beginning singlehander, going below  decks itself can be a challenge. We have grown  accustomed to driving a car, where we don’t take  our eyes off the road for more than 3 seconds.  How could we possibly sleep while the boat  continues to move?  
I suggest that the new singlehander practice  during short afternoon trips, when there is really  no reason at all. He or she should go below for 5  minutes at a time to perform a specific task, like  checking the charts, making coffee or practicing  knots. They must resist the urge to stick his head  on deck for at least 5 minutes. After a few days  of this, the time below deck can be increased to  20 minutes while they cook an entire meal – and  eat it. I suggest that they do not use any  electronic monitoring during this period. Turn  off the radar, AIS or SeaMe. It takes a person  time to become accustomed to sailing on faith  alone for 20 minutes, but it must be done.  Electronic monitoring aids are just that – aids.  They must not become crutches and must not  supplant the skipper’s instincts.  
One piece of advice is that if the skipper can hear  the motor of a ship, he should look around.  Whales may be able to hear ships 50 miles away.  Humans can only hear ships ½ mile away.  
Once the skipper has become accustomed to 20  minutes below, a duration when he could have  run into any number of floating debris, the idea  
of spending an hour or more without looking  around becomes less stressful. At this point the  electronics can be reactivated. It has long been  held that it will take 20 minutes for a ship to  cross the horizon and hit a sailboat. So this is as  long as one should sail on faith alone.

Approaches to sleep:  
It is well known that a person can not “store”  sleep in a bank to use at a later date. However, it  is highly advisable to get the most sleep possible  for two nights before a voyage so that the  singlehander is well rested as he leaves the dock.  Studies have shown that athletic performance is  determined more by the sleep taken two days,  rather than one day, in advance of the event.  Based on this, I make sure to get at least two  very good nights of sleep before any voyage.  This means that I will not drink any alcohol for  these days (alcohol keeps me awake); I get to  bed early (I am a “lark” type sleeper); and I will  even take a sleeping pill so that I sleep soundly  all through the night. I make sure that my boat is  fully prepared two days in advance to reduce  stress and definitely avoid the pre-race parties  that most sailors attend.  
I know that adrenalin will stop me from sleeping  for the first night when I will probably be in a  high traffic area anyway. Starting the voyage  well rested ensures that missing one night of  sleep is not debilitating.  
Once underway, a common method of keeping  watch is to get out of the bunk every 20-30  minutes and take a quick look around the horizon  and at the compass, then go back to sleep again.  The idea is to get back to the bunk before being  completely awake, so that it is easy to fall back  into deep sleep. This is much like a normal  person waking in the middle of the night to  urinate, then climbing back into bed and back to  sleep. With this technique, the skipper is not  intending to work the boat at all, simply check  for hazards. I use this technique and Derek  Hatfield used it in the 2002 Around Alone; he set  an alarm twenty minutes. He would wake up,  check around the boat and go back to sleep for  another twenty minutes. After a few days he  found the alarm unnecessary.  
I use three tips to make this technique workable.  First, I find that getting out of, and back into, a  
sleeping bag in my cramped bunk below deck is  too much of an effort. It takes too long and has a  tendency to bring me fully awake. I have set up  a sitting  
hammock in  
the cockpit,  
made from a  
sail bag. This  
is a very  
comfortable  
place for me to  
sleep, facing  
backwards  
with my head  
against the  
main hatchway  
and my bum  
just slightly  
above the  
cockpit sole. In this position I barely need to  move to look all around the horizon. I can also  reach the autopilot and all three sheets to make  small adjustments if necessary. Modern  singlehanded racing boats have built cockpit  houses to cover the skipper next to the hatchway  for the same purpose. I have taken voyages of  up to five days sleeping only in my hammock.  
Second, I have a small kitchen alarm clipped to  my harness. It is important that the alarm  automatically resets to twenty minutes after each  activation. If it takes concentration to reset the  alarm, once again it wakes me too much.  
Third, eliminate electronics that might wake me  unnecessarily. The ocean is a really big place. I  don’t care if a ship passes 20 miles away or even  
5 miles away. I only want to know if a ship is  passing less than 1 mile away. Radar and AIS  alarms should be set for the skipper’s own level  of comfort. This also refers to the autopilot  “wind shift alarm”. My autopilot has a built in  15º wind shift alarm that can not be adjusted. I  have found this to be too tight a range. On a  gusty run, the wind will shift back and forth by  15º many times overnight. All of these  electronic alarms will not only wake the skipper, 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 11  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

but keep him nervously on-guard, waiting for the  next alarm. This problem led to hallucinations  during the 2006 Singlehanded Transpac. I have  disconnected the wind shift alarm altogether.  
Polyphasic sleep:  
Dr. Claudio Stampi is considered the world’s  greatest expert on “Polyphasic Sleep” for  singlehanded sailors. Through his  
“Chronobiology Research Institute” He has  lectured many times on this topic and his  methodology is often used by top performing  racers. The two basic ideas behind this  technique are reducing the total time sleeping  each day from a normal 8 hours to 5 hours or  less, and to sleep in short naps with productive  time in-between each nap. (NOTE: It is  important that the skipper read this entire  section, including the rebuttal to Stampi’s  techniques. Hallucinations are a wonderful  thing!)  
Here is an exerpt from “MacAuthur is caught not  napping.” The Sunday Times, January 20, 2005:  
THE ocean never sleeps and nor  does Ellen MacArthur. At least,  that is how it seems during her  race to become the fastest sailor  to circumnavigate the world  single-handed. … Sleep  
represents something of a Catch 22; she knows that she must sleep  in order to achieve the mental  and physical condition to keep  making good time but that each  time she does, she is losing  time.  
MacArthur wears a monitoring  device on her arm and the data is  sent to Boston to be analysed by  Claudio Stampi, the chrono biologist with whom she has  worked for the past five years.  
From the start, on November 30,  until January 12, she averaged  5.54 hours sleep a day. But from  
January 6 to the 12th, MacArthur  averaged just 3.9 hours. “Under  normal circumstances this would  already represent quite a  sacrificed sleep allowance in  comparison to the two-week  transatlantic race in 2000, where  Ellen averaged 4.2 hours per  day,” Stampi said. “But this low  sleep quota will have an even  more dramatic impact on someone  who is particularly fatigued  having been at sea for 50 days.”  
MacArthur’s sleep patterns are  usually feverish, mostly divided  into ten or 20 minutes, but  napping is one of her strategies.  According to Stampi, for the 94  days of the Vendée Globe in 2000- 01, MacArthur averaged 5.7 hours  sleep a day, divided into nine  naps. “When you have to go from  an average of 7½ hours a day to  Ellen’s average of 5½,” Stampi  said, “we have seen from many  experiments that it is actually  better to divide those fewer  hours into multiple naps.” …  
Another of Stampi’s suggestions  is the “Sunday Strategy; that is  the strategy of once a week,  declaring a different day — like  a vacation day, or half-day”,  Stampi said. “That is both  psychologically as well as from a  sleep perspective. Sleep seems to  be extremely plastic. One day is  enough to put you back to a very  good level.  
“Ellen, from a sleep physiology  perspective, is a normal person.  Where she is exceptional is in  her drive and discipline. You  will never find a day without  sleep with Ellen. Not every  sailor can do that. Some will  stay a day, two, sometimes three,  without sleep at all. The  benefits of even a short nap are  disproportionate to the  
duration.”

According to Adam Mayers in “Sea of Dreams,”  Brad Van Liew used this technique in the 2002  Around Alone. Brad had taken part in a sleep  study at Harvard University Medical School,  where he learned that he could operate in the  eightieth percentile of alertness with just 4 ½  hours of sleep. During the race he had a 45  minute sleep every four hours.  
Dr. Stampi teaches sailors how to perform best  on minimal sleep. The secret is learning how to  power-nap (pulling an Einstein) His research was  done by base testing cognitive performance with  a normal eight hour sleep. Then he had subjects  shift to three-hour routines. A month later, the  group that had one long sleep of 3 hours showed  a 30 percent loss in cognitive performance. The  group that divided its sleep between nighttime  and short naps showed a 25 percent drop. But the  polyphasic group, which slept exclusively in  short naps, showed only a 12 percent drop.  
Stampi divides sleep into REM (important for  memory and learning) and non-REM (restores  energy). Non-REM sleep itself has four stages:  one, light slumber; two, the onset of real sleep,  (heart rate and breathing slow); three and four,  
deep (slow-brainwave) sleep that is most  restorative.  
Sleepers follow a 90 minute cycle through these  stages with REM between each cycle. Under this  theory, the body needs slow-wave sleep first and  achieves this in the first three hours. If only four  
hours of sleep are possible, the body will still  achieve 95% of slow-wave sleep while missing  most of the REM and stage-two sleep.  
This suggests that slow-wave sleep is the most  critical. That sleep is more valuable at the  beginning of the sleep cycle than at the end. So  if a singlehander takes more naps he is  recharging more efficiently than he would be  with a single longer sleep.  
Stampi notes that a skipper must nap wisely by  tailoring times and lengths to the body’s  
particular requirements. For example sleep  peaks normally occur in mid-afternoon and early  morning, but it is not desirable to sleep in the  early evening. This made scientific sense:  Humans tend to feel sleep pressure at those  times.  
His research showed that afternoon naps had the  most valuable slow-wave sleep, important for  recharging the body. Sailors should try to get at  least some of their quota then. The skipper  should try to get his body “in phase” and cycle  accordingly, so that no time is wasted simply  laying in the bunk with eyes wide open.    
According to the testing, there are two types of  people: morning people, or "larks," and evening  people, or "owls." Larks are good at taking short  naps but are not as efficient at night, and prefer a  regular routine. Owls appear to cope better with  irregular schedules, but prefer longer naps. For  example, Ellen MacArthur is a lark and tends to  spend 60 percent of her sleep in naps of less than  an hour. Mike Golding, on the other hand, is an  owl. Only 23 percent of his sleep time was  devoted to naps of less than an hour. But both  sleep about the same amount while racing,  between 4.5 and 5.5 hours on average.  
An excellent video on Claudio Stampi and  polyphasic sleep is available on Youtube.com.  Search for “Polyphasic sleep study”  
It is difficult to jump into polyphasic sleep on the  first day of a long voyage. Here are some  techniques for adapting to a polyphasic sleeping  schedule, adapted from  
www.sleepingschedules.com:  
• Determine a personal circadian cycle, i.e.  when the body wants to sleep and when it  wants to be active. Every person has his  own, individual circadian rhythm with peaks  and dips in alertness, when they normally fall  asleep and when they normally wake. It  forms the basis of sleep times in the  
polyphasic system. As mentioned above, 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 13  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

most people are designated as Larks and  Owls.  
• Staged transition: Some have found that  staging the transition over three to nine days  helps with success adapting. Start with one  (shorter than usual) core sleep at night and  one afternoon nap. Move to two sleeps at  night separated by a task, along with the  afternoon nap. Increase to three sleeps, etc,  depending on Lark or Owl status.  
• “Core Sleep” is the one longer sleep each 24- hours. Most researchers suggest that this be  when the skipper normally goes to sleep. For  example, I (a lark) normally go to bed at  10pm, and can fall asleep in just a few  minutes.  
• Use an alarm to wake up. The skipper  should never sleep past the alarm.  
• Turn on a bright light to activate the body  when waking. This simulates morning. Get  out of the bunk immediately. Do not stay in  the bunk and daydream, even if awake.  
• Do not attempt to sleep between 6pm and  8pm. Stampi refers to this as the “forbidden  zone.” He suggests that our ancient  
ancestors used this period to ensure safety  before sleeping, so it is instinctive that we  not sleep during this period.  
• Avoid caffeine before scheduled sleep. It is  important not to miss a sleep period if it will  lead to reduced performance later.  
The polyphasic approach does have critics. The  US military has studied fatigue countermeasures:  Each individual nap should be  long enough to provide at least  45 continuous minutes of sleep,  although longer naps (2 hours)  are better. In general, the  shorter each individual nap is,  the more frequent the naps should  be. The objective remains to  
acquire a daily total of 8 hours  of sleep.  
The Canadian Marine Pilot’s trainer’s handbook:  Under extreme circumstances where  sleep cannot be achieved  
continuously, research on napping  shows that 10- to 20-minute naps  at regular intervals during the  day can help relieve some of the  sleep deprivation and thus  maintain minimum levels of  performance for several days.  However, researchers caution that  levels of performance achieved  using short naps to temporarily  replace normal sleep, are always  well below that achieved when  fully rested.  
Dr. Piotr Wozniak has studied the subject and  does not believe it is possible to perform  adequately using these techniques. An excellent  counter view is expressed in a video on  Youtube.com. Search for: “Polyphasic Sleep  Experiment,” where the best line is “I can’t tell if  I’ve been getting sleep or not. I don’t know. I  might be. I’ve got memory gaps. I want some  pancakes.”  
The following is excerpted from  
http://ftp.supermemo.com/articles/polyphasic.htm The theory behind the polyphasic  sleep is that with some effort,  we can entrain our brain to sleep  along the ancient polyphasic  cycle and gain lots of waking  time on the way, mostly by  shedding the lesser important  stages of sleep.  
EEG measurements indicate that  humans are basically biphasic.  There is a single powerful drive  to sleep during the night, and a  single dip in alertness in the  middle of the day. The cycle can  be prodded and shifted slightly  on a daily basis. The degree of  the shift requires a precise  timing of the phase-shifting  stimulus. In other words, with a 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 14  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

stimulus such as light, physical  activity, or social interaction,  we can move the period of maximum  sleepiness slightly. Although the  precise measurements speak of the  possible shift of up to 3 hours  in a single day with a single  strong stimulus, it is hard, in  practice, to shift one's  
circadian rhythm by more than 1  hour per day.  
An increasing portion of the  population use the alarm clock to  do the job that should naturally  by done by sunlight. This is not  a healthy solution and is usually  forced by our electrically-lit  lifestyle with evening TV,  evening reading, evening  
Internet, evening partying, etc.  The well-defined effects of  natural sleep affecting stimuli  on sleep patterns lead to an  instant conclusion: the claim  that humans can adapt to any  sleeping pattern is false. A  sudden shift in the schedule, as  in shift work, may lead to a  catastrophic disruption of sleep  control mechanisms.  
 It appears that polyphasic sleep  encounters the precisely same  problems as seen in jet lag or  shift-work. The human body clock  is not adapted to sleeping in  patterns other than monophasic or  biphasic sleep. In other words,  the only known healthy  
alternatives are: (1) a single 6- 8 hours sleep block in the night,  or (2) a night sleep of 5-7 hours  combined with a 15-90 min. siesta  nap.  
Through sleep deprivation,  polyphasic sleepers can increase  the number of naps during the day  to three. However, the pattern of  one night sleep and three daily  naps in highly unstable and can  be maintained only with a never 
ending degree of sleep  
deprivation.  
The above findings lead to a  conclusion that it is not  possible to maintain a polyphasic  sleep schedule and retain high  alertness and/or creativity!  The answer to the question "to  sleep or not to sleep  
polyphasically" will depend on  your goals and your chosen  criteria. You may want to sleep  polyphasically if you want to  maximize the frequency of a  waking activity (e.g. monitoring  the instruments and the horizon  in solo yacht racing). Yet you  will definitely not want to sleep  polyphasically if: you want to  maximize creative output,  alertness or health. Only when  approaching substantial sleep  deprivation can polyphasic  schedule be superior to biphasic  schedule in that respect.  
Stampi's methods are primarily  targeted at minimizing sleep  deprivation. When speaking about  Ellen MacArthur, he puts his  research in a nutshell: "What  Ellen is doing is finding the  best compromise between her need  to sleep and her need to be awake  all the time". Stampi has shown  that polyphasic sleep can improve  cognitive performance in  
conditions of sleep deprivation  as compared with monophasic  sleep: Individuals sleeping for  30 minutes every four hours, for  a daily total of only 3 hours of  sleep, performed better and were  more alert, compared to when they  had 3 hours of uninterrupted  sleep. In other words, under  conditions of dramatic sleep  reduction, it is more efficient  to recharge the sleep "battery"  more often.  
With the above rebuttals in mind, it appears that  sleeping in short naps spaced throughout the day  is superior to a single sleep of just 3 hours but is 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 2 - 15  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

still far less than ideal. A polyphasic sleeping  schedule was the best compromise between a  need to sleep and a need to be awake. But it is  nothing more than that. Given that the very  reason a singlehander would use this method is  to ensure that the boat remains in control, short  naps are what he would want and need anyway.  Under stressed conditions, he is unlikely to get 3  straight hours of sleep in any case.  
Space Filler: Here is a poem about my first long distance  race, singlehanded against crewed boats. I was on my  Tanzer 22 “Foolish Laughter” on Lac Deschene and the  Ottawa River. I was given two mementos for this race: the  first for hitting three different rocks; the second for being  “the keenest sailor in the race.”  
The Foolish 50 Miles with apologies to Robert Service  
There are strange things done ‘neath the moon and sun  By the men who ply the waves.  
Leaving wives at home they face the foam  
That will blow them to their graves.  
Lac Deschene has seen keen men  
But the keenest it ever did see  
Was the stalwart Captain of Foolish Laughter.  I know him, for that man is me.  
It was the ninth month of ought one,  
the day the fateful race started.  
I said to the wife “Oh, it'll be fun”  
As I kissed her and happily parted.  
With a promise of rain I raised genny and main  And headed out of the harbour.  
But the wind came up fast and struck hard at the mast  As I moved from port tack to the starboard.  
“Shorten sail!” yelled the Captain, “Aye Aye!” said the  Mate  
“We will do whatever we can!”  
But the die had been cast when the crew rushed the mast.  For the entire crew was only one man.  
The genny was doused and a reef in the main  When I first grounded on that lee shore.  
The impact was that of a slow moving train,  
And who knew that I'd do it twice more.  
I raised centre board up and the boat spun around  When I hit hard rock like a shot.  
With the meter destroyed how fast could I go?  I could no longer measure a knot.  
A long beat up river, under storm jib and main  I settled down to my course  
I had just poured black coffee, when it started to rain.  Oh Lord, could it get any worse.  
I raised number one on the down river run.  
At surfing the T doesn't fail.  
The sky grew quite dark when I rounded S Mark  And then came the crack of the hail.  
The wind gusted up to 48 knots  
And my heel reached 60 degrees.  
The jib came down fast, main sheet out to the last  As I waited for much calmer seas.  
Beating up the North shore, could I take any more  Of the wind and the cold and the hail?  
I poured my next cup, taking time to look up  And my gaff hook slipped over the rail.  
Many men have faced grief upon Blueberry Reef  And I was to join that fine crowd.  
It was more like a shudder, kicking c-board and rudder  The boat moaned, but not really out loud.  
Up river again as the darkness it came.  
I passed boats loaded with crew.  
“A great adventure!” I shouted, they laughed in return.  I still had so much left to do.  
Should I have chosen to stop when the genny went “POP”  And parted two feet from the head?  
I touched ground once more as I neared the South shore  Seeking shelter from the gusts that I dread.  
Pure joy made me shiver racing back down that river  And the moon and the stars did appear.  
It was 10:59 when I crossed the end line,  
And put away all of my fear.  
So what's to become of this brave, naive man.  Will my days be happy ever after?  
If you come near the lake bend an ear to the West.  On a clear night in a 10 knot breeze,  
You can just make out the sound,  
Of Foolish Laughter.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Ch. 3: Boat design, selection and setup  What boat to look for:  
The best boat for singlehanding is the one that the  skipper already owns. Owning a boat is 80% of  the way to singlehanding so in owning a boat, any  boat, the skipper has taken the first large step.  There is a boat for every budget; the Cal 20  “Black Feathers” was purchased for just $1,000,  but completed the Singlehanded Transpac. The  first, last and only criteria for the beginner is to  get a boat and get out on the water.  
Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to be a  singlehander without owning a boat. No one is  going to lend a boat to be taken out alone.  
The worst boat is the one that will be purchased  “next year.” I know of too many wannabees who  spend their time searching for the perfect boat, but  never get out on the water. I’ve had many  conversations with these dreamers, asking me  what boat they should buy, doing months of  research on one boat, then another. It seems they  can name every design and model, but they never  pull away from the dock. Until they does so, they  are only pretenders. But the moment they get out  on the water, they become a singlehanded sailor.  Here is my decree: If a person misses even one  season for lack of a boat, he is a dreamer, not a  sailor.  
When searching for a boat, the singlehander has a  terrific advantage over the crewed boat owner. It  seems that the most modern boats, those built  within the past five years and thus the most  expensive, are the least suitable for singlehanding.  Older fiberglass boats, built twenty to thirty years  ago, by their nature have the design features that  are best suited to singlehanding.  
The key features to seek out are:  
1. Helm: Tiller rather than a wheel. A tiller is  almost a requirement for singlehanding, for  several reasons. First, a tiller is designed to be  
used while sitting; a wheel is designed to be  used while standing. There will be times  when the singlehander is at the helm for hours  on end. The ability to sit is paramount.  Second, it is easy to control a tiller between  the knees while standing or under the leg  while sitting. These are necessary when  pulling sheets during a tack or when raising a  halyard. Third, a tiller can be operated from  the front or side, while a wheel is designed to  be used from behind. It takes gymnastic  abilities to extricate oneself from behind  modern wheels that stretch from rail to rail.  The singlehander must be able to move around  the cockpit very quickly to control lines. A  tiller is required regardless of the size of the  boat. Even the most modern Class 40 and  Open 60 designs include a tiller.  
Fourth, a wind vane works better with a tiller  than a wheel. Friction is greatly reduced and  the force from the wind vane is more directly  
transmitted to the rudder stock. Finally, a tiller  opens up more space in the cockpit and  eliminates all the cables and quadrants below  deck which are subject to wear and breakage  and take up useful space. At anchor the tiller  can be raised to the vertical leaving the whole  cockpit free.  
2. Cockpit: Small rather than large. The  singlehander must be able to control all of the  major lines while at the tiller, even if this  means stretching forward with the tiller  between his knees. Modern racing boats have  massive cockpits designed to hold six or eight  crewmembers, with winches on the cabin top  ten or fifteen feet away from the tiller. These  are wholly unsuitable. Older style cockpits  are compact and crowded with just two crew.  These are the best choice.  
3. Mast: Strong and secure. When things go  wrong, a singlehander will put far more stress  on the mast than a crewed boat. The boat will  broach more often and there will be times 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 1  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

when the spinnaker is dragging in the water.  These events are common and must not break  the mast. Modern boats have spindly masts  that snap under the slightest pressure.  
4. A single backstay without running backstays.  Runners add complexity at the very moment -  while tacking or gybing, that the skipper needs  simplicity. A runner can only be allowed if it  will not get in the way during a tack or gybe,  even if it is entirely ignored, and if using the  runner incorrectly will not cause damage to  the sails or mast. At night, in high winds and  tight waters, adding two extra lines to a tack  or gybe is insane. Modern boat designs seem  to add an unending number of control lines.  For the singlehander, the fewer lines the  better.  
5. Below deck: Simplicity is best. An amusing  feature of modern boat designs is having two  heads, even on boats less than 40’. It is  thought that there must be a head for the  owner’s family, along with a separate head for  their guests. Obviously only one head is  required for the singlehander. A two burner  stove is ideal, rather than a big galley. A  small navigation station with minimal  instruments is better than something designed  like the Starship Enterprise. Once again, the  singlehander prefers a simple boat. This is in  contrast to the modern complex boat designs,  so by its very nature will be less expensive  than a comparable crewed boat.  
6. A key reason why autopilots burn a significant  amount of power is that some boat designs are  hard to steer. The sad truth is that some boats  are too heavy and have poorly designed, or  unbalanced rudders. One should carefully  assess the suitability of a particular boat for  long-distance singlehanding before buying it,  and a big part of this is the  
hull/rudder/steering systems. Avoid the full  
keel, barn-door ruddered bruiser that weighs  as much as an island.  
Singlehanding makes up a tiny amount of the total  sailboat market. There are very few boats  designed specifically for the singlehander, and all  have been designed for racers and none for  cruisers. Two types, the Mini 6.50 and the Class  40, are both considered extreme racing machines  and are at either end of the boat spectrum that I  am covering in this book, so I will not examine  them in detail. In addition, nearly all of the Minis  and Class 40s are custom builds.  
Figaro Bénéteau II 
Only one dedicated singlehanded design is being  built in production quantities: the Figaro Bénéteau  II, designed by Marc Lombard specifically for the  Figaro racing series. At 10.15 metres (33’) this  falls in the middle of my coverage range of 20’- 40’. It is reasonable priced new and there is an  active market for used boats and there are even a  number of boats available to lease for a single  racing season (www.classefigarobeneteau.com).  Thus it is worth looking at in more detail. The  reader should understand that this is a serious  racing boat designed to cross oceans. However,  given that the lessons learned from racing any  type of vehicle (car or bicycle) are later  transferred to non-racers, it is interesting to  examine what design decisions were made with  this model.  
“La Solitaire du Figaro” (www.lasolitaire.com) is  a well developed series of singlehanded races  taking place over four weeks in July and August  each year. The races run between various ports in  France, with longer legs to Ireland and back. This  is a true open ocean event. The Bay of Biscay is  considered to have some of the roughest waters in  the North Atlantic.

This is a “one  
design” event,  
open only to the  
Figaro II. This  
boat was  
specifically  
designed for this  
series of races.  
Many of the  
world’s best  
known single 
handed skippers  
enter the series,  
but it is also open  
to amateurs, thus I consider it to be a good  representation of the keen sailor’s abilities.  
The only formalized singlehanded school that I  am aware of is the Artemis Offshore Academy,  which uses the Figaro II to train sailors. John  Thorn provided the following description:  
The Artemis Offshore Academy is a  UK training programme of  
excellence for British short handed sailors, providing a  structure to bring talented  sailors up through the ranks.  Designed to help them win major  offshore solo and short-handed  races in the future, the ultimate  goal is to put a British sailor  in a strong position to win the  Vendée Globe in 2016 or 2020.  
The Academy offers a unique  Scholarship to race on the Figaro  circuit each year with a fully  funded campaign. In a natural  progression to the top of the  sailing world the sailors will  then most likely move into IMOCA  60 racing.  
The Academy has a Development  Squad of eight members as well as  two Associate members. The  Development Squad sailors are  selected at the selections trials  
held once a year at the Weymouth  and Portland National Sailing  Academy. The Associate members  are sailors who already have  funded campaigns but wish to  train alongside the Academy. The  training programme is run from  November to April in La Grande  Motte (France) at the prestigious  Figaro training the Centre  D’Entrainment Méditerranéen  (CEM). The race programme  includes official and unofficial  Classe Figaro events in France  and RORC races in the UK.  
Unfortunately, the Artemis school is only  available to selected members and is not open to  paying students.  
Our interest is not in the race series, but in the  boat itself. I had a long discussion with designer  Marc Lombard (www.marclombard.com) about  his baby. In particular, I asked him to compare  how he designed it to be a singlehanded boat  versus a crewed boat of the same size. I also  spoke with skipper Murray Danforth, perhaps the  only North American Figaro II owner. Most  recently I spoke with Charles Darbyshire,  Technical Director of the Artemis Offshore  Academy, which trains singlehanded sailors in the  UK. He commented “These people train like  Olympic athletes, much more than an amateur.”  
Marc explained that the design team met with a  group of highly skilled skippers of the older  Figaro model to ask for their requirements for the  race series. Naturally there were differing  opinions on every aspect of the boat. In many  cases the majority ruled, but in others the team  had to rely on their own expertise in meeting  conflicting desires.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Final boat cost played a significant role in the  design. The Figaro II is intended to be within the  price range of the average sailor, and not solely  for sponsored professionals. With a length of  10.1 metres, the beam was established at 3.4  metres to control costs.  
The boat had to meet a basic minimum weight of  three tonnes empty, to meet Category A  requirements for open water stability. The final  design came in at 3,050 kg. There are 240 litre  water ballast tanks on each side for upwind  power. The designers were not allowed to use  larger tanks because stability would be threatened  if the boat was sailed with a crew of six in other  races. (Note that the much smaller Mini 650s  have up to 450 litres of water ballast.)  
For upwind sailing, the water ballast can be  transferred from side to side via gravity in about  15 seconds. It is controlled by levers in the  cockpit. The process is to open the valves and  allow the water to drop, then close the valves  again, just before tacking. The ballast is not so  great as to overly tip the boat during this process.  If the tanks are empty, a pump can fill them in  about four minutes. A scoop drops below the boat  for this purpose, or to empty the tanks.  
Marc explained that with the Figaro II, upwind is  where the difference between skilled and  unskilled sailors becomes apparent. The boat  responds quickly to changes in sail trim. To  excel, the skipper must have a strong theoretical  knowledge and a lot of practice in differing  conditions. The twin rudders provide control  regardless of boat heal while beating windward.  
The boat has a single backstay, without runners.  This was requested by the skippers to avoid  tangling with the sails. The mainsail is a  traditional shape without the large headboards  more recently popular. The mainsail will slide  past the backstay in higher winds. In lighter wind,  the backstay can be eased to allow the main to  
pass under. Marc mentioned other recent boat  designs with no backstay. The single backstay  allows the fractional, double spreader  
mast and main to be adjusted as necessary for  optimal trim in upwind racing.  
The mainsail is a large 36 m² with two standard  reef points. The fractional foresail is only 28 m².  Marc described this as desirable for fewer  headsail changes, a benefit to singlehanders.  
The cockpit was designed so that all the major  controls can be accessed by the skipper while at  the helm. The jib sheets cross over the cockpit to  the windward side of the boat, allowing him to  make adjustments while seated.  
For downwind racing, the hull has a wide, flat  stern with twin rudders. This was a particular  requirement to singlehanding as the boat will  
often be run by autopilot. The design allows a  skipper to launch and gybe a spinnaker in 30  knots of wind with the pilot in full control. The  hull shape is incredibly stable in these conditions.  Marc explained that downwind, the boat becomes  more stable the faster it goes. He commented that  the twin rudder design will stop any broach in its  early stages. Broaches are very rare in the races,  even when the boats are pushed to their limits. As  a user, Murray Danforth confirmed this stability.  He commented that the rudders really dig into the  water and grip it very tightly. A narrow hull with  single rudder would be much less stable. Watch  the video at: http://tinyurl.com/33npp7 for a great  view of sailing in 55 knots wind. Note in  particular 1) the skipper’s light hand on the tiller;  2) how the autopilot is able to hold course when  he is on the bow; 3) the stern view showing the  twin rudders grip on the water.  
There was debate between the skippers over the  choice between symmetrical and asymmetrical  spinnaker. In the end, majority ruled and the  symmetrical chute was chosen. According to  Marc, the Figaro is a tactical race where skippers 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 5  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

want a complete range of options in their route.  Symmetrical spinnakers allow for much deeper  sailing, and thus more routing options.  
I asked Charles Darbyshire how they train his  students performs a spinnaker gybe in 30 knots of  wind. This is something that they practice  extensively. His first answer was “very quickly.”  They use twin sheets and guys and twin fore guys  (pole downhauls). Most important, they have no  wasted movements. Charles contrasted them  against an expert crew on a Mumm 30: The  singlehanded skipper only makes one trip to the  bow and one trip back to the cockpit. He  performs all the necessary tasks during this one  trip, grabbing lines along the way fore and aft.  They gybe the main first, then move forward to  gybe the pole. The entire process is described  fully in Chapter 7.  
Charles pointed out that the spinnaker design for  the Figaro II is much more stable than another  performance boat of similar size. A key to gybing  is completing the entire maneuver while at the  fastest point of sail, while surfing down a wave  when the pressure on the spinnaker is least.  Problems will occur if the skipper is delayed past  this brief window of opportunity.  
An NKE autopilot package is normal for the boat,  but the skippers can install any brand as desired.  The autopilot controls are normally mounted next  to the main hatchway, but again this is up to the  individual. Most skippers use a remote control for  all of the autopilot functions, including gybing  from the foredeck. Charles noted that the  performance settings of each racing boat are set  individually, after many hours of personalized  testing. The racers even change the gain settings  for upwind and downwind legs of a race to get the  maximum performance.  
Multi-hulls  
A quick note to say that multi-hulls require a skill  set that it well beyond the scope of this book and,  
I believe, well beyond the abilities of all but the  most experienced singlehanders. The issue is that  cat’s and tri’s have a nasty tendency to flip. Once  overturned, there is no way to bring them back  upright. Multi-hulls are constantly sailed on the  razor’s edge. It takes an experienced helmsman to  keep them under control. An autopilot cannot  reliability perform this role, but singlehanding  relies on an autopilot. So there is a necessary  contradiction.  
Several years  
ago a major  
transatlantic  
race was held  
with mono-hulls  
and multi-hulls.  
Although the  
weather was  
typical for the race, 40% of the multi-hulls  capsized and required rescue. To me it is  puzzling that one would enter a race with a 40%  (or even 5%) chance that they will need rescue.  
As I have mentioned elsewhere, self sufficiency is  the bedrock of singlehanded sailing. The skipper  should be able to get himself to port under all but  
the most extreme circumstances. I don’t believe  that an extra strong blast of wind is sufficient  reason to require rescue.  
Insurance: 
Five years ago, as I was preparing for the  Singlehanded Transpac, I contacted my insurance  broker about the trip. This company, which is  promoted by my yacht club, claimed to be  specialists in marine insurance. They rightfully  requested my sailing resume and, as expected, it  showed my extensive singlehanded experience.  However, not only did they refuse to insure my  race, they doubled my normal premiums because I  singlehand my boat so much. It was obvious that  they had no understanding of me or of  singlehanding in general. I was appalled and  dropped them immediately with severe prejudice.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Clearly, insurance is one of the major problems  facing singlehanders. There are many companies  that claim to be marine specialists, but very few  have any understanding of singlehanding. It is not  that we face extra risks, but that we face different  risks that can be managed appropriately.  
It is a sad fact that only a very few underwriters  are willing to look at singlehanded boats  anywhere in the world. This is a significant  problem for the brokers. I spoke with a large  marine insurance underwriter. They were willing  to take on singlehanders for coastal sailing with  strict conditions, but not offshore racers. They  said that there was simply not enough data for  them to make good a good judgement on  insurable risks.  
Fastnet Marine Insurance, in the U.K., is one of  the world leaders in obtaining insurance for  singlehanded sailors and in particular racers.  Fastnet is a broker, as such they seek out coverage  on a policy by policy basis from insurance  underwriters who provide the actual coverage.  They are willing to attempt to find coverage for  singlehanders located anywhere in the world, but  they are only able to do so if the Insurance  underwriters are licensed to in that location. As  such, they have struggled with yachts in the U.S.  because there are only a few underwriters able to  provide this coverage.  
I posed a number of direct questions to Richard  Power, their Director of Business Development.  
The role of the insurance broker is to develop a  proper relationship between the sailor and the  insurance company. Like a marriage guidance  counselor, the best way to do this is by ensuring  that both parties are aware of “material facts”  before they enter the relationship. From the  insurance company’s point of view, sailing or  racing the boat singlehanded would definitely fall  under the heading of material fact.  
The singlehander is approaching any insurance  company with a significant handicap. His hobby  is certainly difficult and might even be considered  illegal. Without advance planning, the skipper’s  negotiating position is virtually nil.  
There is some level of truth to the idea that an  insurance company will try to avoid paying out on  large claims. The role of the insurance broker is  to make this as difficult as possible - before the  accident occurs.  
Thus, it would be unwise for a sailor to simply  announce to the company that he was a  singlehander, without significant further  qualification in terms of how he is managing the  special circumstances. The skipper should list  both his experience and the changes made to the  boat particular to ensuring a claims free  singlehanded passage. The list should include:  • Watch keeping equipment: AIS, radar, Sea me, etc.  
• Redundancy in autopilot equipment.  • Knowledge of unpowered self steering  methods, (like in this book..)  
• Strength of the mast; renewed standing  rigging, etc. (mast breakage is a major cost to  insurance companies).  
Insurance companies have clauses particular to  marine insurance, and these have special  significance to the singlehander. These are  fundamental requirements, placed on the  shoulders of the skipper, which should be  considered paramount:  
“You will exercise reasonable care to make  the Vessel Seaworthy at the start of this  policy, and you will exercise reasonable care  throughout the period of insurance to make  and keep the Vessel in a Seaworthy condition”  (Allianz Yachting and Boating).  
What is “seaworthy” on a crewed boat is  obviously different from what is seaworthy to a  singlehander. The skipper needs to ensure that his  is a seaworthy singlehanded boat. Some insurers 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 7  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

could legitimately state that keeping the vessel in  a “seaworthy condition” includes making sure that  she is properly manned and that a lookout is  maintained at all times. To have any level of  success, the skipper must put forth a valid counter  argument with his application.  
Some policies have strict limitations on  singlehanded voyages:  
“You are covered for singlehanded passages  not exceeding 24 hours but not otherwise,  providing the Vessel is suitably equipped.”  (Navigators & General Yacht & Motorboat  policy)  
“The Vessel must only be sailed between the  hours of sunrise and sunset local time and  only for a cumulative total of 50 nautical  miles per day unless she is manned by two  people of adequate physical strength at least  one of whom is competent to be in command.  (Yachtsure 10/95 policy)  
But for all yacht insurance policy wordings, the  Insurers would not expect the yacht to be sailed,  let alone raced, singlehandedly, unless they had  agreed to this in advance.  
The experience or inexperience of the sailor  would be reflected in the policy price. Richard  emphasized that they would try to avoid punitive  pricing by gathering as much detail about the  yacht preparations as possible. He would use this  information to negotiate the best possible terms  with the insurers. Skippers with relatively little  experience will be asked to provide extensive  detail on proper yacht preparation, taking expert  advice, taking courses, etc. Richard commented  that inexperience is not necessarily reflected in  insurance pricing as long as the requested details  are forthcoming.  
In terms of pricing, singlehanders can expect to  pay more than a similar crewed yacht - up to 50%  higher premiums. For example, a Figaro II,  would be insured in the region of £1,250 to  
£1,500 for a year’s coverage, including the SORC  series and full racing risks.  
However, it is with the deductable that the real  differences appear. The skipper should expect a  significantly increased deductable on actual  damages when sailing singlehanded. Richard  suggested that SORC entries should expect to pay  a deductable of approximately 1% - 1.5% of the  value of the yacht, compared to ½ % or even less  for a fully crewed yacht. There would not be  much difference in this deductable for  singlehanded cruisers versus racers, given that the  type of singlehanded sailing being done (i.e.  cruising or racing) is specifically endorsed to the  policy.  
Richard emphasized that singlehanded cruisers do  not face the same risks as racers, and are able to  negotiate better rates. I asked if he would be able  to provide insurance for “an extended cruise to  many exotic ports around the world?” Richard  replied that as long as the skipper installed  appropriate self steering gear and other necessary  equipment, and he maintained that gear  throughout the voyage, coverage would not be a  problem. If any breakdowns occurred, the skipper  would be responsible to carry out repairs at the  earliest opportunity – certainly he would not set  off on any voyage over 24-hours without full  operation.  
The more boat preparation and the greater detail  available, the better the broker is able to negotiate  terms with the underwriter. For example, having  the most modern watch keeping equipment on  board will be a factor in their discussions.  
Insurance underwriters are adverse to skippers  with a bad claims history. I would suggest from  this that skippers should limit claims to the truly  serious amounts, certainly amounts greater than  the deductable. It is better to eat a few thousand  Euros now than have insurance refused later. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 8  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

As the most possible extreme in singlehanded  sailing, I asked Richard to look at the Global  Ocean Race for Class 40 yachts. Fastnet is  looking to be a key supplier of insurance to these  skippers. Obviously as a round-the-world race  this is not indicative of what most singlehanders  will require, but it does point toward the type of  questions that should be considered by every one  of us. The six page questionnaire included:  • Detail any accidents/claims/losses.  • Did the losses take place whilst racing?  • List all offshore voyages over 1000nm, for  
each year, over the past 10 years; fully  crewed, short handed, singlehanded.  
• List all offshore races over 1000nm, for each  year, over the past 10 years; fully crewed,  short handed, singlehanded.  
• Include any information about your yachting  experience which may affect potential  insurer’s judgement about your application.  
• Detail your plans/programme for the yacht  over the next 12 months, including refit work,  trials, qualification voyages and races, sponsor  entertainment days, etc. Include the locations  and indicate which voyages/races will be  singlehanded, double handed, etc.  
• Provide material and builder of the main  components: hull, mast, rigging, rudders,  engine.  
Fastnet hopes that they will not need to refuse  anyone because of inexperience. They are  working to demonstrate to the underwriters that  Class 40 is a capable offshore boat. Additionally,  they want to prove that the safety procedures  adopted and enforced by the race organizers lead  to insurable risks for all entrants.  
Pricing for a round-the-world race will reflect the  additional risks of total loss from a relatively  minor event that would necessitate abandoning  the boat. For example, a boat stricken in the  English Channel can be towed to port. The same  boat in the Southern Ocean is a write off; the cost  or even the possibility of salvage is unrealistic.  
Richard suggested that premiums will be in the  range of 3% to 4% of the boat’s total value, or 2-3  times the normal rate.  
On the other extreme, I asked Richard to look at  Mini 650 racers. He commented that they have  not been able to find any UK underwriter to cover  them. He knows of only one company, in France,  that will provide this coverage. So Fastnet is not  sourcing insurance for the Minis. “We have to  draw the line somewhere.”  
Boat Setup  
Jack lines:  
I start with jack lines because I consider them to  be the most important item on my boat. As a  serious singlehander, I alone am responsible for  my life. I sail in the North Pacific, where the  water temperature is never above 12°C. If I  become detached from the boat more than a few  hundred yards from shore, I’m dead. It’s that  simple.  
Jack lines should be made from strong, flat  webbing. Do not use a rope line or tubular  webbing because it will roll under foot. The jack  lines must be mounted so that the singlehander  can walk from the bow to the stern without  unclipping the harness. It is completely  unacceptable to use jack lines which require  unclipping when passing the shrouds or sheets.  On my boat the shrouds are slightly inboard, so I  run the jack lines outside of the shrouds and jib  sheet, but inside the lifelines.  
The jack lines can run very close to the bow.  However they must stop well short of the stern,  such that the skipper will not drag even an inch  behind the boat. It is simply impossible to pull  oneself back up a line with a boat moving at 5  knots. Add the length of the tether to the back of  the jack lines to see the total length. Then either  shorten the tether or shorten the jack lines. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 9  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Because jack lines are such a vital piece of  equipment, I suggest leaving them permanently  mounted on the boat. Do not remove them when  returning to the dock, because the temptation will  be to not replace them the next sunny sailing day.  Nylon jack lines will deteriorate in the sun, so  they should be purchased annually.  
The Pacific International Yachting Association  has set these standards for Jack-lines on crewed  boats:  
Jack-lines with a minimum  breaking strength of 4,500 pounds  (2040 kg) shall be fitted each  side from cockpit to bow such  that crew can clip on before  leaving the cockpit. Jack-lines  shall be attached to fittings  equal to the full strength of the  attached jack-line.”  
 “Safety snap-on line and harness  for each crew member. The  
recommended assembly shall be  ready for use, all components  attached. Load-bearing  
components, including attachment  fittings, shall withstand a  static load of at least 700  kilograms (1540 lbs.) The safety  line shall attach to the harness  at chest level and the harness  shall support the upper back.”  
Falling overboard is obviously a rare occurrence.  I posted a request for experiences on the Petit  Bateau forum, and these are the responses I  received. These responses are from different  skippers, thus may be conflicting:  
• In 1999, Harvey Schlasky and a  crew member sailed in the  Double-Handed Farallones Race  out of San Francisco. They had  rigged jack lines from pulpit  to push pit, i.e., the entire  length of the boat. When  
knocked over, the crew member  was thrown across the boat and  
dragged alongside it. He was  able to climb back on board.  Unfortunately Schlasky’s tether  slid to the end of the jack  lines, so he was dragged behind  the boat and perished.  
• In this year's OSTAR I got  washed overboard whilst  
changing headsails. I was  hanging over the upper  
guardrail - bashing against the  hull as we continued at 5 knots  under main in around 25 knots  of wind. I have a second  
shorter lifeline on my harness  & used this to attach myself  under the lower guardrail to  the jackstay, before releasing  the longer one, & slipped back  on board - very quickly! I did  have the benefit that a  
Contessa 32 has low freeboard.  
• I was washed overboard in a  very bad storm on Ostar '76  about 1000 miles west of the  Scillies. I was hove to with a  storm jib and fully reefed  main. My wind speed indicator  (analogue in those days of  course) had been on the stops  at it's limit of 60knots for  most of the night. I was  
sitting in the cockpit in the  early hours, having decided to  remove all sail and run under  bare poles. I was trying to  work out the best way of going  about it when a breaking wave  knocked down my 32ft Pioneer  10. She had been coping with  the huge waves until the  
breaking one arrived. I was  washed straight over the side  as she capsized and when I  eventually surfaced, I was very  relieved to find my harness was  still attached and in one  piece. The next problem was to  get back on board. I was over  the port (lee) side with my 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 10  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

lifeline attached to it's  anchorage point on the cockpit  sole. One option was to work my  way round to the stern and use  the Aries to climb back aboard  but I didn't fancy that as it  meant detaching myself from the  lifeline. While pondering the  problem, the solution presented  itself because the next big  wave rolled the boat. I was  able to wait for the next wave  and when the boat rolled  towards me, I grabbed a  
stanchion base and get a leg on  to the boat, then as it rolled  upright I slid in under the  guard rail.  
I was lucky to be able to get  back aboard and two things made  it possible 1) the boat was not  moving forward as the sails  were trashed by the capsize and  she had been hove to. 2)  because of the huge waves and  the boat being broadside on to  them she was rolling heavily.  The strange thing is that in a  flatter sea, I would have had  much greater difficulty getting  back aboard.  
If a singlehander goes over the  side with the boat under way  with any forward speed and the  boat is being controlled by a  windvane or autopilot, it would  be nigh on impossible to get  back on board unless he has a  means of bringing the boat head  to wind. With a windvane such  as an Aries, one could arrange  to have control lines over the  stern and bring her head to  wind. I can't think of a way to  do it under electronic  
autopilot. It is a nightmare  scenario to imagine being over  the side and being towed along  by boat doing 6 or 7 knots.  
• I have been involved in several  man overboard trials. It may  seem illogical but it is much  easier getting back on a moving  boat than a stationary one –  unless that is you are  
unfortunate enough to fall over  to windward. There are two  reasons for this. 1. the  
freeboard is less as the boat  is heeled towards you. 2. As  you are towed on your lifeline  your body is on or near the  water's surface. Once, when  being towed at about 5 knots, I  was able to hook an arm and a  leg over the rail and roll in  under the guard wires.  
For the AZAB 75 and OSTAR 76  (also in a Pioneer 10) I rigged  weighted lines, one each side  from about midships to the  stern so that when deployed  they would hang about 2 feet  below the surface. These were  held on deck by some light  twine, the theory being that I  could reach the line in the  water, yank it to break the  twine and have a loop in the  water to help me step  
(delicately) back on board.  Luckily I never tested it.  Andrew Bray, EDITOR, Yachting  World  
Tether: A tether should use proper, strong  carabiners like those used by mountain climbers  or properly made for sailing harnesses. The  skipper must be able to clip and unclip the tether  quickly with one hand, for two reasons:  
First, if it requires two hands, there will be many  times when the skipper forgoes clipping on simply  because one hand is busy on the tiller or holding a  sheet. I will repeat this sentiment several times in  the book. A singlehander is just as likely to fall  off the boat on a stormy day with high winds  when he is being extra careful as he is on a nice 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 11  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

day when nothing significant is happening, but is  just off guard for a fraction of a second. It is on  one of those nice days when he might just skip  clipping on if it is the least bit difficult. Human  nature is such that people will avoid  
“unnecessary” work unless it is made as simple as  possible.  
Second, the skipper must be able to unclip with  just one hand in situations where the other hand is  busy. For example, if the tether gets caught on a  cleat in the middle of a spinnaker gybe. It is  much easier, and in the end probably safer, to  unclip rather than leave the spinnaker pole  swinging across the boat. I am not so unrealistic  to think that the tether must be worn every second  of every voyage. The easier it is to clip on and  clip off, the more likely that the skipper will wear  it more of the time.  
Some boaters insist on locking carabiners. I have  no problem with this concept as long as they can  be quickly and easily fastened and unfastened  blindly with one hand. In nine years of running  all over my boat dragging my tether, I have never  had a carabiner detach from the jack lines or my  harness, so I don’t feel that a locking mechanism  is necessary. I have heard of situations where the  jack line runs parallel to a sheet and the carabiner  runs onto the sheet. My suggestion is to move the  jack line to a new position where this can not  happen.  
Some races insist on a quick release mechanism  for the clip. I disagree with this concept. First, I  have never seen a quick release mechanism that  
can be easily fastened with one hand. If this can’t  be done, it won’t be used for the reasons  mentioned above. Second, I can not imagine the  circumstances were I would want to be detached  from the boat. Even if I am thrown overboard and  dragging injured beside the boat, this is a much  better situation than watching the boat sail away.  I can see the safety advantage of a quick release  on a crewed boat, but not singlehanding.  
The tether must be long enough so that the skipper  can move from rail to rail without unclipping  during normal tacking or gybing. After a tack, it  will be necessary to unclip from the leeward jack  line and clip to the windward jack line in order to  walk up the windward side of the boat.  
A solution to this is to use two tethers – one on  each side of the boat. Both tethers must still be  long enough to reach across the boat. After each  tack and when settled on the new course, the  skipper can just clip onto the windward tether.  
A different  
configuration  
is to skip the  
jack lines  
and use a  
longer tether  
fastened to  
the centre of  
the deck aft  
of the mast. This tether must be long enough to  reach both the bow and stern, but once again not  allow the user to drag behind the boat. This  system will only work if the mainsheet and  traveler are on the transom, so that the skipper  need not unclip for every tack.  
Hand rails A  
single-hander  
must be able to  
work his way  
to the bow,  
even under  
very rough  
conditions. But  
the distance  
from the mast to the bow is very much a no-mans  land. On a typical boat there is nothing solid to  hold on the foredeck. Lifelines are not sturdy and  do not provide a stable grip. In fact it is very  common for singlehanders to avoid the bow  during a storm, leaving a jib that is too large for  the wind. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 12  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

A set of hand rails mounted on the foredeck will  solve this problem. I’ve mounted hand rails  along the toe rails on both sides of the boat. I can  crawl to the bow under any rough conditions to  change the jib for a storm jib.  
Lines in General:  
Crewed sailing boats have made tremendous  advancements with tuning all aspects of the mast  and sails. This has led to an incredible number of  control lines mounted around the boat. With a  full crew, it is possible to handle these lines, but a  singlehander must concentrate on only the key  lines that will create the most significant change.  Lines that only offer incremental advantages  should be avoided – the skipper does not have the  time or energy to manage them all. A small  number of lines will provide 95% of the control  possible from a significantly greater number. The  singlehander should accept this 95% and  disregard the remainder.  
Lines are also a threat to the safety of the sailor so  the number and length of lines should be reduced  as much as possible. Especially at night, lines are  
likely to be everywhere around the boat. It is  impossible to eliminate the lines but it is possible  to make them manageable. The only way is to  store the lines in exactly the same place every  time.  
Halyards  
It is commonly thought that all of the halyards  should be lead to the cockpit. This is certainly  true for the jib and spinnaker, but not necessary  for the mainsail.  
The main halyard can be left on the mast because  it is usually the first sail to raise and the last to  drop. On most sailing days the singlehander will  only raise and lower the main one time. As well  the skipper will likely be at the main halyard  when the motor is running and the boat is flat on  the water. The main is probably the most  
physically difficult sail to raise in terms of weight  so we don’t want to add extra turning points that  require extra effort. Even in the worst possible  weather, it is still safe to take the few steps from  the cockpit to the mast to put in a reef. When  reefing the main, the skipper must be at the mast  to tie it up anyway. Having the main halyard  right next to the reefing line on the mast is very  convenient. It makes it possible to drop the main  and tighten the reef lines from one position.  
One problem with having the main halyard on the  side of the mast is the difficulty of reefing in a  heavy wind when the halyard is on the leeward  side. It is an awkward position if the boat is  listing 45° while attempting to handle the halyard  from the bottom side. In these cases I just tack so  that I’m on the top again.  
The jib and spinnaker halyards are used in tandem  and are used several times for each trip, so they  should be lead to the cockpit. The halyard  clutches should be mounted in a spot where they  can be reached with the tiller between the legs,  even if it is a stretch. The day will come when a  really beautiful spinnaker run turns into  something stronger than the autohelm can handle -  or it will have quit altogether. The skipper must  be able to drop the spinnaker while steering the  boat. Since the spinnaker drop requires both  hands, steering with the knees is necessary. The  singlehander should make these measurements at  the dock by stand in the cockpit with the tiller  between his knees. How far he can reach is the  limit of where the jib and spinnaker halyard  clutches should be mounted.  
Storage of the halyards of a raised sail is an  important consideration for both convenience and  safety. The best way to store halyards is in a rope  bag positioned directly under the halyard clutch.  This serves two purposes: first, it stores the  halyard safely out from underfoot. It is not  possible to trip on a halyard tucked inside a bag.  Second it allows the halyard to run free when the 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 13  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

sail is dropped. The skipper should not have to  worry about the halyard jamming during a drop.  
Line must not be coiled inside a rope bag. The  coil will tangle on itself inside the bag. Rather,  the line should be shoved into the bag starting  with the bitter end. Simply shove the line into the  bottom of the bag, one handful at a time until the  entire line is inside. This puts the end of the line at  the bottom and the entire line will come out in the  correct order.  
Because halyards are always stored in their bag in  the same place on every voyage, the skipper will  instinctively learn to avoid them in the dark.  Even if he does catch a halyard on his foot, he  will know exactly how to shed it in the dark  because he will have done it dozens of time in the  light.  
Winches:  
Self tailing, two speed winches are vital to the  singlehander. A significant amount of sheeting  will be performed with one hand and it will be  impossible to put the entire weight of the body  into cranking, as is normal with a crew. Spend  
the money to purchase a good set of winches.  They are used more than any other mechanical  device on the boat, so they must work well. Also  keep the winches well greased. This will have a  significant impact on their performance.  
Sheets:  
Virtually all sailing is done sitting on the  windward (high) side of the boat. As well, the  bulk of maneuvering the boat is done by hand,  rather than with an autohelm. So set up the sheets  to operate from the windward side while  maintaining one hand on the tiller.  
Jib sheet winches should be mounted just in front  of the normal, high side, seating position, where  they can be operated easily with one hand while  the other remains on the tiller. Most winches  come with a strong intended mounting direction,  
i.e. they are designed to mount in a particular  direction. On a normal boat with winches on the  leeward side, the winch would be aimed forward.  However, on a singlehanded boat, the sheet will  be coming up from the leeward side to the  windward side. So the winch must be aimed  toward the leeward side. (The installation manual  for the winches will indicate the strong direction.)  
A permanent turning block on the leeward side of  the boat is required to bring the jib sheet from the  leeward side to the windward side. Thus, when  sailing on a starboard tack, the jib sheet will run  down the port side of the boat to a turning block,  and then up to a winch on the starboard side next  to the skipper. It is very handy if the turning  block has a locking mechanism in place that will  allow the sheet to be locked even if it is removed  from the winch. There will be times when the  winch is needed for other purposes, such as for  the spinnaker sheet.  
Sheets are used continuously on any voyage, even  the shortest. A new pile of sheet is formed with  every tack. These piles are never neat and get in  the way of any activity in the cockpit. A very  easy method to reduce the length of lose line in  the cockpit is to use a single, continuous sheet.  This is rarely seen on boats but is incredibly  practical. It will eliminate virtually the entire  sheet piled in the cockpit. A single, continuous  sheet will be longer than one normal sheet, but  much shorter than two sheets.  
To create a continuous sheet, start with one end  tied to the clew of the jib. Run the sheet  backwards through the blocks on the leeward side  of the boat, around the windward winch with three  wraps, around the leeward winch, through the  blocks on the windward side of the boat and tie  the remaining end to the sail clew. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 14  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  


It is very important that the sheets have no twists  prior to starting this process, using the method  described above. It is also important to wrap the  sheet three times around the windward winch and  one time around the leeward winch. This puts the  exactly correct number of twists into the line.  Thus the line laying in the cockpit will remain  twist free during the  
sailing trip.  
(Most sailors coil their  
lines in an 0 shape. This  
actually puts one twist in  
the line for each loop of  
the 0. It is better to coil  
heavy lines in an 8 shape.  
This is the natural way  
that lines want to fall, and does not add any twists.  The first time, hang the jib sheets from the mast to  remove all twists. Then, coil them in an 8 shape  thereafter.)  
It will take practice to become accustomed to the  continuous sheet method. But once mastered it is  clearly the better approach.  
Spinnaker sheets  
Because of the potential for trouble, it is even  more important that the spinnaker sheet be run  back to the singlehander sitting at the tiller. It  
may be possible to run the spinnaker sheet  directly from the spinnaker sheet block, across the  boat to the jib sheet winch on the windward side  of the boat. My boat has a second set of winches  on the cabin top. I use these winches for the  
spinnaker sheet and guy during the launch. After  the spinnaker is raised, I move the sheet back to  the jib winch on the windward side and take my  position at the tiller. I leave the guy on the cabin  top winch. When singlehanding the guy is used  much less than the sheet and is rarely needed in  emergencies. (In fact in most cases having the  guy slightly out of reach stops me from using it in  emergencies, which is the best thing.)  
Cleats  
Another tripping threat is hardware, in particular  cleats. These should be moved away from the  main walking areas. A cleat that is directly  underneath the lifelines is less likely to trip than a  cleat inboard by just a couple of inches. Other  hardware should be grouped to create avoidable  areas, rather than scattered randomly around the  deck. Leave open paths from the deck to the  cockpit when mounting hardware. After just a  few days on the water the skipper will intuitively  learn to follow the open paths.  
Clutches  
As boats have become more complicated with a  greater number of lines, the number of rope  clutches has grown significantly. Some sailors  have spread these clutches across the deck in an  attempt to keep the lines neat. But this takes up  the entire deck space, leaving no room to walk. It  is very important that adequate walking space be  left on both sides of the boat and on the cabin top.  It would be virtually impossible to walk on top of  lines with the boat healed at thirty degrees. The  lines will roll under foot. In conjunction with the  earlier comments about reducing the number of  control lines, clutches must be interspaced and  overlapped to reduce the overall footprint and  leave a significant amount of walking space.  
Tweaker Lines (Twing Lines)  
Tweaker lines are small diameter lines that run  along the spinnaker sheet at the widest point on  the boat. They are used to pull the sheet and guy  into the boat and add control. They are invaluable

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

to the singlehander because they can control the  sheet and guy when the spinnaker pole downhaul  is released for gybing in higher winds. I use them  often.  
Sails:  
Singlehanding causes significantly greater wear to  sails than crewed sailing. The key reason being  that there are many times where a sail will be left  to flog for extended periods while something  more important or perhaps even critically  dangerous, is sorted out. For example, I was  entering a narrow channel hoping to keep the  spinnaker up from a run to a beam reach with the  winds blowing at 20 knots. Both the sheet and  guy got away and the chute was streaming from  the mast straight out the side. For at least two  minutes it was impossible to turn downwind  without running into the rocks. Only after passing  the channel marker was I able to turn, activate the  autohelm and douse the sail. The spinnaker was  flapping wildly during this time and undoubtedly  suffered extensive wear. A crew would have  pulled the chute down immediately but it was  impossible alone.  
In other cases, the mainsail will be flogging  wildly while it is reefed in 40 knot winds or the  genoa will be smashed into a ball and shoved  below deck when 10 knot winds suddenly gust up  to 20. Neatness and proper sail packing takes a  distant second place to safety when the skipper is  on a bucking, wet foredeck in these situations.  
High tech, Mylar or Kevlar sails are fantastic if  properly handled by a crew but will crack and  break under the flogging conditions typical to a  singlehander. Watching a $5,000 sail split in his  hands will bring tears to any sailor’s eyes.  
These plastic sails are also nearly impossible to  repair. Mylar kits are available to mend small  splits, but once patches are being applied over  older patches, it can be assumed that the sail has  finished its life. Experience has shown that  
extensive singlehanding will destroy these sails  beyond use in one or two years. The trouble with  high tech sails is that they go from practically  perfect to completely useless in an instant. There  is no middle ground lasting years or even months  when they are still workable.  

Unless the singlehander has money to burn,  standard Dacron sails will be the only possible  choice. Although Dacron will not hold its airfoil  shape past the first few seasons, at least it will still  be workable for many years. Dacron sails are  also very simple to repair with a sewing machine,  an awl, or even a needle and thread on the high  seas. The expense of a few trips to the sail loft for  repairs will convince the singlehander to learn  these skills.  
With Dacron, it is even possible to unstitch old  repairs and start fresh. This will be necessary at  key stress points, such as batten pockets which  will split open under flogging conditions.  (Specialty sewing machines are available for sails  at a reasonable price, but even cheaper are old  sewing machines from the 1960s. These have  metal gears necessary for sail repair.  
Modern machines with plastic gears  
are useless.)  
An awl with fine waxed thread is  
excellent for hand sewing. It is  
much better than standard needle and  
thread for repairs in the middle of a

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

sail because it is worked mainly from one side. It  will also push through multiple layers of sail cloth  at seams and edges. www.speedystitcher.com  
Mainsail: The main must have at least two and  preferably three reef points. The first reef point  will be used very often. The second reef point a  
few times a year and the third reef point once  every year or two. It is impossible to predict the  weather or the winds. A day that starts with a  nice breeze can turn into a nice gale at any  moment with little warning. A singlehander must  be prepared to deal with these changes in a  seamanlike manner. This means properly  reducing the main and jib. It would be  irresponsible to leave the dock without the ability  to reduce sail to meet any wind conditions.  
Lazy Jacks: One of the greatest difficulties in  singlehanding is raising, lowering and reefing the  mainsail and boom. The main will flop around  wildly until it is completely raised and the boom  will bang  
violently inside  
the cockpit. A  
topping lift from  
the top of the  
mast to the end of  
the boom will  
stop damage from  
the boom, but it  
does not help in  
managing the sail.  
An additional  
problem is in  
neatly folding the mainsail for storage on top of  the boom. I’ve watched this to be a challenge for  a crew of four. It borders on impossible for a  singlehander.  
Lazy Jacks solve both of these problems. These  are a network of lines that run from a single point  well up the mast to multiple points on both sides  of the boom. Lazy Jacks should be designed to be  pulled away from the boom and secured on the  
mast when the boat is underway. They are known  to get tangled with the mainsail battens. Some  larger boats use fabric covers around the boom to  hold the sail. These are a problem because it is  very difficult to work with reef lines while  reaching under the fabric.  
Jib and Genoa: The key to the fore sail is that it  must go up and come down easily from the  cockpit. This usually means that hanks are  preferable to a sail foil.  
When raising the jib on a foil, even with a pre  feed, is likely to jam and the singlehander must  rush to the bow, release the sail and rush back  again to pull on the halyard. When dropping the  jib a foil will not let it fall to the deck on its own.  Hanks solve both of these problems. Hanks rarely  jam on the way up and will quickly drop by at  least a few feet when the halyard is released on  the way down. It is very simple for the  singlehander to grab armfuls of genoa and pull the  sail down onto the deck when using hanks.  
In my experience Wichard hanks are preferable to  piston hanks. The piston  
type requires two hands to  
hank on or off – one hand to  
pull the piston and one hand  
to move position the hank on  
the forestay. This can be  
dangerous or even impossible  
when crouched in a bouncing pulpit. Wichard  hanks can be easily clipped on or off with one  hand while the other is holding on to the boat.  The small ends of a piston hank are impossible to  
grab with gloved hands – not an issue with  Wichard hanks, and the piston hanks will seize  with salt, again not an issue with Wichard hanks.  
Wichard hanks have a drawback for boats using  an asymmetrical spinnaker. If the jib is still  raised, the spinnaker sheet may get caught in  Wichard hanks as the spinnaker is gybed. This is  a known problem on Mini 6.50 boats. This is 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 17  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

only a problem with asymmetrical spinnakers, not  with symmetrical chutes.  
Regardless of the type used, hanks on all sails  should be positioned in the same direction so that  the singlehander knows, even in the dark, which  direction is used to hank-on or hank-off a sail. On  my boat all sails: the genoa, jib and storm jib all  hank on from port to starboard.  
A handy device is to run a line up the forestay,  woven between just a few of the hanks to the head  of the sail. This line is run through a block on the  deck and back to the cockpit. When the halyard is  released, the skipper can pull this line to pull  down the foresail.  
Although rarely seen, reef  
points on the fore sail are  
a good idea. These are  
common on the Mini  
6.50s. Changing head  
sails is difficult and  
exhausting. It is unlikely  
that a singlehander will  
want to reduce from a #1  
to a #2 for a slight  
increase in wind strength.  
But such changes would  
be common for a crewed  
boat. It is more likely that a singlehander will  drive the #1 past its suggested wind range or will  jump to a #3 before its required wind strength.  Putting reef points three feet up from the bottom  of the genoa will solve this problem by making  the jump to a #2 sail size much easier. The same  practice holds for the move from a #3 to a #4.  
The tack position on a reefed foresail should not  be at deck level. The entire foot of the reefed sail  should be at least six inches above the deck.  Otherwise water will collect in the bundle of  material at the foot of the reefed sail. A short line  should be used from the tack of the sail to the  boat. In addition, small drain holes with proper  
grommets should be positioned along the sail a  few inches below the reef points.  
I do believe that a singlehander should use the  largest sails designed for the boat. Some have  suggested that we not use a genoa but stick with a  jib for ease of tacking. I want my boat to sail as  fast as it is designed, so rather than sacrifice  speed, I have learned how to use the designed  sails.  
Roller furling sails are a great convenience for  the cruising singlehander. The key advantage  being that it is very easy to reduce sail from as  much as a Genoa to a tiny handkerchief with just  the pull on a line. Obviously they completely  eliminate the problem of dropping and bagging  the foresail. I know of several round-the-world  singlehanders who have used roller furling sails  very successfully. Their key disadvantage is the  only real reason they are not used half rolled by  racers: roller furling sails are cut for their fully  extended position. They lose their aerodynamic  shape and wing effect the moment they are rolled.  
Larger boats have used two roller furling sails to  eliminate the sail shape issue. A second forestay  is positioned a few feet back from the head stay.  
Of course every new solution offers its own  problems. The largest head sail must be tacked  through the relatively small gap between the two  forestays. This is not an issue on long voyages  but will be inconvenient in short tacking  situations. As well, sailors go to great lengths to  reduce weight up the mast. It is not appealing to  leave a large sail, permanently mounted all the  way up to the top of the mast. This is a very  significant amount of weight that must be  counterbalanced at the keel.  
This problem is corrected if the entire rolled sail,  including its foil, stay and roller, can be dropped  to the deck as one complete unit. This is an  incredibly neat and efficient way to store a sail on  deck. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 18  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

A self tacking jib is a real convenience for the  singlehander. Many modern racing boats use a  larger mainsail with a jib, rather than a genoa.  Self tacking jibs slide from side to side during  tacking and require no effort at all. Only when  sailing on a reach is any adjustment made to the  jib sheet.  
Positioning of the autopilot: It must be possible  to operate the autopilot from the tiller position.  During a typical sail there will be many times  when the autopilot is turned on and off, even for a  few seconds. Some of these times will be very  rushed so it must be within convenient reach. For  example at the start of a race the skipper will be  hand steering, but may need to rush to the bow for  a few seconds to skirt the jib. Using the autopilot  for just a 10 second spurt is very typical, even in a  cruising situation where the skipper just needs to  find his coffee cup. Autopilots are covered in  detail elsewhere.  
Spinnaker Socks 
I am not a fan of  
spinnaker socks. In  
the first case, they  
are just not  
necessary on 20’- 
40’ boats. If the  
skipper follows the  
detailed instructions  
set out in Chapter 7,  
she will never get  
into trouble with a  
spinnaker in any wind conditions. On the other  hand, there are several drawbacks to socks. The  most obvious is the extra lines and sock itself are  prone to fouling at the top of the mast. Second, a  singlehander should do everything possible to  reduce weight up the mast. A bunched up sock is  a lot of weight and wind resistance. The third,  and worst, issue is that the skipper must move to  the bow to work the sock. It is easy to imagine  using a sock on a nice sunny day with a moderate  breeze. But what happens when the wind  
increases to 20 knots against a current, and the  waves are a choppy 4’ high. Is this the time for a  sailor to be standing on the bow with her arms  above her head? It is very easy to drop the chute  directly into the cockpit under these conditions,  but difficult to use a sock. The boat is better off  without it.  
Spinnaker Net  
A spinnaker net is used to stop wraps around the  forestay. Nets are usually  
home-made from light  
webbing material, with sail  
hanks to connect to the  
forestay. The net is stretched  
between the forestay and  
mast. The biggest problem  
with nets is that they become  
a tangled mess when stored  
below deck. They should be  
tied in a nice bundle before  
storage. Another issue is that  
the net is in the way of the  
spinnaker pole uphaul during  
a gybe. My net has a very light bungee cord to  connect to the mast. (The white line visible in the  photo.) This bungee cord allows the net to be  pushed out of the way by the uphaul during the  gybe. It defeats the purpose of the net if it must  be disconnected from the mast in order to gybe.  
Spinnaker Design: 
The Figaro II uses spinnakers that are designed to  be “stable” for singlehanded sailing. I contacted  Rick McBride with Leitch McBride Custom  
Sailmakers in Sidney, British Columbia. They 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 3 - 19  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

have a strong reputation with the local racing  community. Rick explained the differences  between a stable and a flat spinnaker. The skipper  should keep in mind that all spinnakers act like a  wing, with air flow from the luff to the leech,  even when sailing deep downwind.  
A stable spinnaker is designed to be used with  minimal attention to sail trim. It will fly even as  the apparent wind oscillates back and forth in  normal conditions. A flat spinnaker requires  constant trimming or it will collapse. A stable  spinnaker will have greater cord depth. This  allows the boat to sail higher or lower without the  sail stalling. It will also have a more elliptical  leach allowing the luff to fold over on itself  without collapsing. A flat sail will collapse if the  leading edge folds over at all.  
Like the wings in a jet airplane, a flat spinnaker  will be faster, but more prone to stalling or  collapsing than a stable spinnaker designed for  singlehanding. There is a trade off between speed  and stability that will depend on how much the  skipper is able to work the sheets over hours at a  time. The above drawings are highly exaggerated.  In reality a stable spinnaker will have a cord depth  only a few percent greater than a flat chute.  
Miscellaneous items:  
The key idea to boat setup is that those things that  are used minute to minute are positioned within  reach of the singlehander sitting at the tiller.  Items that are used less often require the  singlehander to stand up in the cockpit; and items  that are normally used just once per trip require  the singlehander to leave the cockpit.  
Over time I have added many convenience items  to the boat. For example, I have a coffee cup  holder right next to the tiller. If I am hand  steering for several hours, it is nice to know that  my coffee is within reach. I’ve also added a  holder for my GPS unit, so that I don’t drop it in  the cockpit or overboard (which I’ve done.)  
I have attached cloth bags just inside the main  hatch for items that I am likely to use only once  each trip. I can put sunglasses, sunscreen, a spare  knife, gloves and my GPS when not in use inside  these bags that can be accessed just by stepping to  the hatch.  
The singlehander should think about what he uses  during a voyage, and find his own way to store it  appropriately.  
Build a single fingered boat for desk voyages:  Print the next two pages back-to-back. (The *  mark should be approximately even on both sides  of the paper.)

Ch. 4: Power systems  
Electricity is the greatest cause of frustration to  every singlehanded sailor. Electrical problems  will lead to more voyage cancellations than any  other issue and electrical problems will cause the  skipper to spend more time in uncomfortable  twisted positions below chart tables than  anything else. Here are some quotes from highly  experienced singlehander Jeanne Socrates’ blog  over just eight days:  
• Managed to short across  circuit while testing AP drive  motor ...40A fuse blown - no  spare...!  
• Went to use multimeter to  check fuse - 'dead as a  
Dodo'...! Battery gone - no  spare  
• Used heatshrink butt joint to  bypass fuse and join wires  together - there's another 40A  fuse in same circuit so  
protected still... Discovered  instruments now permanently on  - despite switch at chart  table - seems I damaged relay  in blowing circuit  
• About to see if I can find out  what the problem is with my  ship's VHF radio - confirmed  yesterday as not transmitting.  Means getting (with  
difficulty!) to behind the  instrument panel yet  
again..... grrr! Maybe I'll  be able to see why my SSB  radio has lost its GPS input  while I'm back there..... and  have another go at fixing the  lost connection between the  same VHF radio and the AIS  unit...  
• "In for a penny, in for a  pound" ... I delved deeper and  removed the Pactor modem and  HF/SSB radio front to see if I  could restore the missing GPS  input to the radio - another  loose connection dealt with  ... YES - success!  
Lat/long/UTC - all displayed  again... I felt I deserved the  dark chocolate I rewarded  myself with later, after my  meal!!  
Jeanne has circumnavigated alone twice and is  on her third trip. She has faced these types of  problems since I met her 5 years ago. The  problems listed above were encountered on a two  year old boat with completely new electronics.  She has had numerous professionals working on  her boat and has become nothing less than an  expert herself. There is only one answer. If a  boat contains electronics, they will go wrong –  without question.  
So the singlehander faces two options: first is to  attend university for four years to receive a  degree in electronics engineering; second is to  drastically reduce the amount of electronics on  board. I prefer the second option.  
I AM A SAIL BOAT. I NEED ONLY WIND  TO MOVE MY MASTER SAFELY AND  COMFORTABLY TO ANY PORT IN THE  WORLD.  
This should be engraved on a bronze plaque and  mounted inside every singlehanders boat. I love  sailing. I want to spend my weekends sailing, not  
searching out fuses or looking for lose wires.  And when I undertake a long offshore voyage, I  do not want to be stopped by something that  takes four years of university to understand.  
Before leaving the dock, a singlehander must  ensure that the boat can be sailed safely to its  destination even with a complete power failure.  A power failure will occur – depend on it.  
Modern civilization teaches us that electronics  are the source of all safety, comfort and  happiness. (Take away any teenager’s cell  phone to prove my point.) By modern I mean  just the last ten years. Two decades ago no sailor  would leave port without knowing how to use a  compass and sextant. Today a chart plotting GPS 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 1  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

tells us where we are, what heading to the  nearest port and the location of every rock in between. Just four decades ago, the famous  singlehander Bernard Moitessier undertook the  Golden Globe Race without even a radio. He  communicated through passing ships to the race  headquarters using signal flags. Today, how  many skippers would even notice if they passed  a boat signaling one of the distress messages.  
I have rambled on for a page and a half to make  one point: Electronics is bad. It will break.  Luckily, it is not necessary for the prepared  singlehander. The chapter on sailing techniques  explains how to sail with no autohelm or wind  vane. A singlehander is not prepared to leave the  dock until he understands these techniques.  
However, I am not so naive to think that we can’t  use electronics to make our lives easier. The  first thing a singlehander should do is reduce the  amount of electronics on the boat so that  inconvenience is limited in the event of a  complete power failure. The skipper should seek  out and eliminate any electronic gadgets on the  boat that can be done just as effectively  manually.  
The second step is to cut power consumption on  necessary items simply by turning them off. In  her famous Vendee Globe race, Ellen MacArthur  commented that she was spending eight hours a  day using a computer and internet connection to  research the weather. I was studying weather  forecasting at the time, and asked her what she  was researching in eight hours that could not be  done in a half hour. She answered, “nothing”.  The simple reason is that the boat was sailing  itself perfectly without her constant input. She  was just spending time. But she was also  wasting power.  
The singlehander should use a computer as  necessary, but no more so. If it takes a half hour,  then don’t spend one hour or eight hours. Turn  the computer off and read a book.  
Sailors have a bad habit of leaving instruments  running for the entire voyage, for example by  leaving the GPS chart plotter running 24 hours a  day in open water. Why? Every boat has a  mechanical compass. The GPS should be  activated for a few minutes every four hours just  to check the course. After that, it should be  turned off again and the mechanical compass  used. Another good example is collision  avoidance equipment. The radar, AIS, Sea-Me  or CARD should only be used when the skipper  is below deck. They should not be used when  the skipper is on deck day or night, except in  thick fog. The skipper has eyes; he should use  them and not waste more valuable power.  In particular, the display screens on electronic  devices can burn an inordinate amount of power.  At the very least, the display screens should be  put into sleep mode when not in active use.  
As a third step, stay in DC. Nearly all  electronics in the world are designed to function  in DC power. Those that are intended for home  use have added a built in AC adapter that  converts the power from AC to DC before it  enters the unit. (The AC to DC inverter is the  small black box commonly found on the end of a  power cord.) There is a very significant power  loss in moving from AC to DC. So all  electronics should be run directly from the boat  battery using a DC to DC converter that converts  the standard 12V to whatever is required for the  instrument.  
Power Budget:  
Planning a power budget is tricky because there  are several uncontrollable variables. The basis is  that the skipper should calculate all of the power  requirements for his boat. A simple spread sheet  is the best way to tackle this issue. I’ve attached  a sheet from the Pacific Cup.  
Virtually all of the power usage figures are  available from the users’ manual or web site for  each piece of equipment. For example, a quick  look at the Raymarine web site indicates that the

model AIS 250 has power requirements listed at  200mA. But, when building the spreadsheet the  skipper must remember that some equipment  only works in conjunction with others. For  example, the AIS 250 is designed to work with a  multifunction display which consumes another  250mA.  
The greatest risk in power consumption  calculations is with the auto pilot because this is  by far the leading user of power. An error here  has one hundred times the consequences of an  error in the running lights. The problem being  that the pilots’ consumption is directly related to  weather conditions which are difficult to predict  when building the system. For example, the  B&G T2 hydraulic pump has a power  consumption range from 5 Amps to 22.5 Amps.  Actual power consumption within this range will  depend on the pilot responsiveness required for  the direction of sail (running downwind requires  greater power) and the wind/wave conditions (A  choppy sea will consume much more power than  flat water.)  
Power Generation:  
Given everything mentioned above, the single  best method of meeting power requirements is to  cut power requirements. Reducing power  requirements will reduce cost, reduce problems  and reduce the risk of abandoning a voyage.  Reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce. It’s easy to  remember and it works. After meeting a large  part of the power requirement by eliminating it,  the singlehander can take the next step and  determine which method of power generation is  best for his boat and his sailing.  
Watts, kilowatts, hours: Power is discussed in  terms of Watts or kilowatts or kilowatt hours.  Power (in Watts) is equal to Volts x Amps.  Since we are almost always dealing with 12  Volts, we can often ignore the aspect of Amps  and just work directly with Power.  
The “Watt” is the instantaneous measure. For  example a solar panel with a 40 Watt output  could power a 40 Watt light bulb (assuming no  losses). A kilowatt is equal to 1,000 Watts. A  kilowatt-hour is a constant stream of one  kilowatt for one hour. A solar panel with a 40  Watt output would require 25 hours of sunshine  to generate 1 kilowatt hour of power. A battery  that stores 1 kilowatt hour of usable power  would light ten 100 Watt light bulbs for one  hour. For most batteries, only about 50% of  listed capacity is actually “usable” if one expects  a reasonable battery life.  
Examples:  
• My boat has 130W of solar panels. During a  sunny day at sea I can plan that they will  receive usable sunlight for 9 hours. 130 x 9  = 1,170Wh or approximately 1.2 kWh.  
• An auto pilot requires 5W under easy  conditions and 22W under difficult  
conditions. We might assume an average of  8W during our voyage. Over a day this is 24  x 8 = 192Wh. However this could be as high  
as 22 x 24 = 528Wh over an entire day of  rough seas.  
• A Sea-Me Radar reflector is listed as using  150mA. This is 0.15A, so 0.15A x 12V =  1.8W. Running the Sea-Me for 6 hours  while sleeping will require 1.8 x 6 ≈ 11Wh.  
Batteries: First, it is impossible to “force”  power in to a battery. A battery draws power in,  just like sucking it up a straw. Power can not be  forced in any faster than the battery wants to  draw. A deeply drained battery will draw power  in quickly. A battery that is nearing capacity  will draw power in slowly.  
Power will flow in any direction, from the  highest to the lowest. So the only way to charge  a battery is to supply power at a higher voltage  than what the battery contains. So, for example,  a solar panel may be called “12 Volt”, but this is  the nominal value. In fact it will supply more  than 12V. This is necessary because in order to 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 5  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

charge a 12V battery, the solar panel must supply  a greater voltage.  
Because a drained battery draws power much  more quickly than a battery near capacity, it is  rarely worthwhile attempting to fill a lead-acid,  GEL or AGM battery all the way to capacity  while at sea. The battery will fill from 50% to  80% much more quickly than it will fill from  80% to 90% or 90% to 95%. That is, it will take  much longer, even in the same sunshine, to get  the battery from 80% to 90%, than it will take to  get it from 50% to 80%. Many skippers will  plug into shore power over extended periods to  get their batteries up to 100%, but only charge to  80% while at sea. It is a more efficient  approach. As will be indicated later, lithium  batteries operate differently.  
Much of the information below is sourced from:  http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm    
Internal resistance is the issue. Slower charging  and discharging rates are more efficient. A  battery rated at 180 amp-hours over 6 hours  might be rated at 220 AH at the 20-hour rate, and  260 AH at the 48-hour rate. Much of this loss of  efficiency is due to higher internal resistance at  higher amperage rates - internal resistance is not  a constant - kind of like "the more you push, the  more it pushes back".  
Starting batteries are commonly used to start  and run engines that need a very large current for  a very short time. They have a large number of  thin plates for maximum surface area. The plates  are composed of a lead "sponge", similar in  appearance to a very fine foam sponge. This  gives a large surface area, but if deep cycled, this  sponge will be consumed and fall to the bottom  of the cells. Automotive batteries will generally  fail after 30-150 deep cycles if deep cycled,  while they may last for thousands of cycles in  normal starting use (2-5% discharge).  
Deep cycle batteries are designed to be  discharged down as much as 80% time after  
time, and have much thicker plates. The major  difference between a true deep cycle battery and  others is that the plates are solid lead plates - not  sponge. This gives less surface area, thus less  "instant" power like starting batteries need.  Although these an be cycled down to 20%  charge, the best lifespan vs cost method is to  keep the average cycle at about 50% discharge.  
Marine batteries are usually a hybrid, and fall  between the starting and deep-cycle models. In  the hybrid, the plates may be composed of Lead  sponge, but it is coarser and heavier than that  used in starting batteries. It is often hard to tell  what is in a "marine" battery, but most are a  hybrid. Starting batteries are usually rated at  "CCA", or cold cranking amps, or "MCA",  Marine cranking amps - the same as "CA". Any  battery with the capacity shown in CA or MCA  may or may not be a true deep-cycle battery.  
Plate thickness (of the Positive plate) matters  because of a factor called "positive grid  corrosion". This ranks among the top reasons for  battery failure. The positive (+) plate gets eaten  away gradually over time, so eventually there is  nothing left - it all falls to the bottom as  sediment. Thicker plates are directly related to  longer life, so other things being equal, the  battery with the thickest plates will last the  longest.  
Automotive batteries typically have plates about  .040". The typical golf cart will have plates that  are around .07 to .11" thick. While plate  thickness is not the only factor in how many  deep cycles a battery can take before it dies, it is  the most important one.  
There are several types and technologies for  batteries: The major construction types are  flooded (wet), gelled, and AGM (Absorbed  
Glass Mat). AGM batteries are also sometimes  called "starved electrolyte" or "dry", because the  fiberglass mat is only 95% saturated with  Sulfuric acid and there is no excess liquid. 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 6  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Flooded may be standard, with removable caps,  or the so-called "maintenance free" (that means  they are designed to die one week after the  warranty runs out). All gelled are sealed and are  "valve regulated", which means that a tiny valve  keeps a slight positive pressure. Nearly all AGM  batteries are sealed valve regulated (commonly  referred to as "VRLA" - Valve Regulated Lead Acid).  
Flooded: 6V golf cart batteries: What? Golf  cart batteries on a boat? Yes, this is what I use.  I have a pair of Trojan, 240 Amp Hour, 6 Volt  golf cart batteries installed in series to produce  12V. These are standard flooded lead acid  batteries that must be checked and refilled  periodically. I use these for a few reasons, first  they have a very deep cycle, meaning that they  provide a steady stream of power for a long time,  exactly what I need to run an autopilot for hours  or days on end. And they have a high cycle life,  i.e. they can be deeply discharged many times  before replacement. Think about what they were  built for, to run a golf cart through 18 holes,  several times in succession before they are  recharged overnight. The golf course does not  want to replace these batteries every three  months. Second, they are the least expensive of  any type of battery for the amount of power they  supply and they are readily available, from any  battery shop. (I notice that West Marine is  selling the exact same battery under the name  “SeaVolt”). Golf cart batteries are not optimized  to provide “cranking” power required to start an  engine, however they will not be damaged when  used for this. These batteries can spill very  dangerous acid, so must be properly secured in  the boat to survive even a complete knockdown.  
My own experience has shown that they are a  good choice; on the return trip to Hawaii, they  twice ran my autohelm and electronics through  several days of completely overcast conditions  without a blip. I have recently replaced my  batteries after constant use over five years. The  cost of replacing the pair was just over $300.  This is why I would recommend golf cart  
batteries over any other type of standard lead  acid battery.  
Gel batteries have added a silica gel to the  liquid to stop it from sloshing around or spilling.  They are sealed so never need refilling.  However, there are several disadvantages. One is  that they must be charged at a slower rate to  prevent excess gas from damaging the cells.  They cannot be fast charged on a conventional  automotive charger or they may be permanently  damaged. This is not usually a problem with  solar electric systems, but if an auxiliary  generator or inverter bulk charger is used,  current must be limited to the manufacturers’  specifications.  
AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries infuse the  electrolyte into a fibre mat between the plates.  These have the non-spillable benefits benefit of a  gel battery, without the limitations on charging.  However, AGMs cost 2 to 3 times as much as a  flooded battery with the same capacity.  
A battery "cycle" is one complete discharge and  recharge cycle. It is usually considered to be  discharging from 100% to 20%, and then back to  100%. However, there are often ratings for other  depth of discharge cycles, the most common  ones are 10%, 20%, and 50%. The buyer must be  careful when looking at ratings that list how  many cycles a battery is rated for unless it also  states how far down it is being discharged. For  example, most golf cart batteries are rated for  about 550 cycles to 50% discharge - which  equates to about 2 years.  
Battery life is directly related to how deep the  battery is cycled each time. If a battery is  discharged to 50% every day, it will last about  twice as long as if it is cycled to 80% DOD. If  cycled only 10% DOD, it will last about 5 times  as long as one cycled to 50%. This does not  mean it cannot go to 80% once in a while. It's  just that when designing a system with some idea  of the loads, an average DOD of around 50%  should be considered optimum. Also, there is an 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 7  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

upper limit - a battery that is continually cycled  5% or less will usually not last as long as one  cycled down 10%. This happens because at very  shallow cycles, the Lead Dioxide tends to build  up in clumps on the the positive plates rather in  an even film.  
Lithium Batteries: Bruce Schwab, who has  sailed his Open 60 around the world twice, has  studied battery power extensively and made  these comments on the new lithium batteries. A  full discussion is available on Youtube.com:  Search for “Bruce Schwab talks about Lithium  marine batteries”:  
No, they’re not for everyone…but  that’s only because they cost a  lot up front. The good news is  that they are relatively new to  the marine market, so the prices  will come down eventually.  However, here is a big point:  over the life of the batteries  they may actually cost LESS per  cycle or per kWh used than  lead/gel/agm. How can that be?  This is because lithium batteries  can be used for 2000-3000 cycles  at 80% DOD (Depth of Discharge)  levels. Compare that to the  typical <400 cycles of an AGM  battery at only 50% DOD.  
Furthermore, as noted above the  last 20% or so of the  
lead/gel/agm capacity is rarely  available while sailing, because  it simply takes too long to  charge  
them all  
the way  
up. With  
a good  
lithium  
system  
they can  
absorb  
charge at  
an  
enormous  
rate.  
How fast?  
Up to “3C” continuous, which  means three times the Ah  
capacity, in amps? For example;  if you had a 360Ah Genasun  lithium system you could charge  it at 900A+ (!) up to 90-95% of  capacity. In reality, no one on  a boat will charge that fast (you  would blow any normal fuses,  anyway) but the point is that the  batteries can take it.  
So, at “normal” fast charging  rates, you can get to 95%+ of  capacity before the voltage goes  up and the current is reduced by  the alternator regulator. What  does this mean? It means that a  full 75%+ of the lithium capacity  is “useable” and in the fast  recharging range, compared to  only 30-35% of lead/gel/agm.  
Ok, so you’ve done your power  budget and you came up with an  average consumption of 10A/hr (at  12V). So you’d like 240Ah @ 12V  of useable power for 24hrs, so  that you only have to charge once  per day. If you have a  
lead/gel/agm you would need a  roughly 720Ah bank to get 252Ah  (35%) of useable capacity to  reach your 24hr target. That  size of lead battery would weigh  as much as 500 lbs, and the  expected life would be 250-500  cycles at 50% DOD.  
With a good lithium system of  360Ah capacity (1/2 of the lead),  you would have 270Ah of useable  capacity at the very conservative  75% capacity use. The system  would weigh about 123 lbs and  have a cycle life of 2000-3000  cycles at 75-80% DOD. That is  about ¼ of the weight, and 4 to 6  times the cycle life.  
Using a Victron Telecom 180Ah  telecom as an example, four of  them (for the 720Ah) would cost  roughly $2350. A Genasun LiFePO4 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 8  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

(Lithium Iron Phosphate) 360Ah x  12V system retails for $7700. So  that’s 4 to 6 times the cycle  life and ¼ of the weight for  about 3.28 times the price. And  we haven’t mentioned the possible  fuel savings from faster  
recharging (depending on how much  charging power you can pull out  of your engine/generator), and  the reduction of amps actually  used due to less voltage drop  with lithium.  
The BMS modules (circuitry on top  of the battery) do several  things; they measure the voltage  and temperature of the cells and  send the info to the BMS master.  The BMS master then tells the  modules when to shunt off a  little energy (when needed) to  balance the cells with each  other. Once a bank is in balance  the corrections are very very  small, so very little energy is  lost.  
 The better BMS's do balancing  full-time, whenever there is a  voltage difference and either  charging or discharging. Some  simpler ones only shunt/balance  at a set voltage point.  
Oh, that reminds me…did I mention  the reduced voltage drop and the  greater amps in/out efficiency?  Or the lack of “Peukert’s Effect”  with lithium (the loss of  capacity under high loads  exhibited with lead)?  
Creating Power  
Solar  
Panels:  
Here is a  
bold  
statement:  
Solar panels  
are the best  
method of  
generating power – no question. Any other  method should be selected only if solar panels  will not work. Solar panels are the first choice  because they are the simplest possible solution.  No moving parts, nothing to break, nothing to  wear out, nothing to fix – ever. I’ve used my  solar panels for five years without giving a  thought to even the slightest bit of maintenance.  They just keep working. About the only thing  that should be done is an annual current test to  ensure none of the connections are broken and  the panels are still providing maximum power.  A solar panel system only has three parts, the  panels, a charge controller and the batteries.  That’s it.  
Solar panels can be added as required for  particular voyages. I have 40 watts permanently  mounted on the boat to meet all of my normal  requirements fifty weeks a year. I add another  50 watts on a mat for my annual offshore trip,  and another 40 watts hanging off the transom for  longer voyages. With 130 watts Foolish Muse  had no problem sailing to Hawaii and back.  
This system  
is not  
optimally  
mounted.  
The wind  
generator  
and radar  
cast a  
significant  
shadow  
across the  
solar panels.  
In a knockdown the entire framework would be destroyed.  
I believe that for simplicity, the best option is to  have the panels mounted flat on the boat. Other  systems are mounted on a moveable frame that  
allows the panels to be aimed more directly at  the sun. This will generate more power,  particularly in the morning and evening.  However, it does move away from my concept of  maximum simplicity. If the boat has sufficient  solar panels, aiming them at the sun will only  add a small amount of extra charging. Keep in

mind that we are only trying to get to 80%, so  the extra effort to get to 100% is rarely worth the  effort. Rigid and flexible panels are available,  however rigid panels supply much more power  so are recommended. It is certainly possible to  use several panels to meet the contours of the  boat deck. I use a series of panels, each  measuring 13” x 5”, across the stern of the boat.  This fits the curve very closely.  
Solar panels must be mounted where they have a  clear view of the sky. A shadow covering 1/3 of  the panel reduces its output to zero. Even a  small shadow reduces output significantly. For  this reason the best mounting location is on the  stern or transom of the boat, behind any shadow  from the mainsail or mast. A panel mounted on  the cabin top will be partially shaded all of the  time.  
With a solar panel system, a Charge Controller is  required. A charge controller limits the rate at  which current is added to  
apparent, the generator will output about 40  watts of power. However, if sailing downwind  in the same 5 knots true and 2 knots apparent,  the generator will not produce any power at all.  It has a startup requirement of 5 knots. In  researching wind generators I’ve found a huge  range in power output. In 10 knots of wind  speed, rated power outputs range from 10 to 50  Watts. The skipper is encouraged to research  this carefully. It appears that the modern designs  produce significantly more power than older  models.  
A key consideration is in mounting the unit well  away from any operational area on the boat. I  have seen the photo of an offshore sailor who  was seriously cut by the wind generator blade  while reaching over the transom. The wings on a  typical generator will be 46” or 120 cm across.  They take up a significant amount of room so  must be mounted well above the transom of the  boat. Of course the higher up it is mounted; the  higher is the weight and resistance on the boat.

I have also found that many generator companies  

provide the optimum voltage when the batteries  are drained, for example after a long night of use.  
Wind Generator:  
Wind generators have become increasingly  popular over the past decade. The have become  more robust and much quieter. Noise has always  been a complaint against wind generators and  noise reduction has been an area of significant  research. This in itself is a reason to closely  examine later models. Prices for typical units  run in the $800 to $1,200 range.  
Of course to function, the wind generator must  be in an apparent wind. So, all else equal, they  will generate much more power sailing up wind  
than down wind. For example, if sailing upwind  in 5 knots of true wind to produce 10 knots  
are no longer in existence. It takes little  investment to start one of these companies on the  boutique level, so there is no guarantee of  longevity.  
A few better known brands are:  
AirBreeze: www.airbreeze.com  
Ampair: www.ampair.com  
KISS: www.kissenergy.com and svhotwire.com  Water Generator:  
There are three types of water generators, fixed,  towed and a hybrid. The fixed units are bolted  directly to the transom and hang below. The  towed units are mounted on the stern rail and  towed behind the boat on a long line. The hybrid  units are towed on a short shaft. The  significance of all water generators is that they 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 10  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

only depend on boat speed, and not on relative  wind speed. As such, they are just as efficient  moving up or down wind. This is very important  on extended downwind voyages – our greatest  wish. Any type of water generator will create  drag. This is not as important for cruisers, but  obviously significant for racers. The  
significance of the drag will be greater for  smaller boats, i.e. a 20’ boat will notice much  more drag than a 40’ boat. Of course as  described above, these should only be left in the  water for the time necessary to bring the batteries  up to 80% - the most efficient charging period.  
Fixed: Fixed type generators have recently  appeared on the scene. They bolt directly to the  transom of the boat and extend into the water  below.  
They can be  
swung up  
when not in  
use. These  
are being  
used in the  
big Open 60  
singlehanded races. The Watt & Sea model  specifications indicate that it can produce an  astounding 500 Watts of power when traveling at  just 8 knots. There is some drag slowing the  boat, but the rational is that it is less than the  drag of carrying 300 litres of fuel required to  produce the same power with a generator on a  very long voyage. This unit sells for the equally  astounding price of $6,650 for the basic unit.  The racing version is more. Obviously it is  aimed at the serious market.  
Here are some comments Mike Hennessey made  on the Sailing Anarchy forum:  
The cruising version is about  $6,500 USD and the racing version  is about $18,000 USD. The  difference between the two  versions is that the racing has  variable pitch blades that  feather the blades based on boat  speed (e.g. drag minimization)  
while the curising version has  fixed blades. The race version is  also 1 kilo lighter than the  cruising version.  
A good number of Class 40's have  either installed or are going to  install the units. Several  installed them for the Route du  Rhum. In the US, the Atlantic Cup  organizers are encouraging  participants to install the  units, in keeping with their goal  for a green regatta. The Class  40's have all been going with the  cruising version since the drag  that is dealt with by the  variable pitch control starts to  become a real issue at over 12  knots of boats speed, and in a  Class 40 the best way to deal  with that is to simply pivot the  generator out of the water and  wait for slower boat speeds to  charge. The Class 40's tend to  average 9 knots or so, which  makes this a viable choice for  Class 40's.  
The amp budget for my boat is in  the range of 200 amps a day. For  an IMOCA 60 it is not going to be  that much more, just what is used  to cant the keel. The problem  with a 5 amp device is that it  just is not going to make that  much difference for the drag  penalty you pay. And I am still  going to need to haul heavy  deisel fuel around, or a genset,  or a fuel cell. I frankly have a  similar issue with solar panels -  I just don't have enough space on  the deck to have enough panels to  produce enough power that would  make me fossil fuel independent.  
The Watt & Sea unit can do that.  4 to 5 hours of deployment a day  and I pay for my entire amp  budget. Sunny days or shady. And  while it won't help in really  light conditions, I can basically

count on it any time the boat is  going more than 4 to 5 knots. 
Towed: For  
a true towed  
generator,  
there is  
nothing but  
a propeller  
and shaft at  
the end of a  
30 metre  
line. The line is connected to a generator on the  stern rail. Thus the propeller and line both rotate  all the way up to the rail. This type of unit will  generate about 12 Watts of power for every 1  knot of boat speed. However, to me it seems that  towing a 30 metre rope behind the boat is a lot  like towing a drogue, designed to slow the boat.  There have also been instances of towed units  being eaten by sharks and the rope is prone to  foul in bouncing seas.  
Hybrid: The  
hybrid water  
generator is  
made up of a  
ridged shaft  
and propeller,  
approximately  
8’ long, fixed  
to a generator on the rail. The shaft is gimbaled  to move with the water. The propeller has a  “diving plane” or wing to keep the propeller  below the water. The unit I looked at was rated  for 72 Watts of power at 5 knots of boat speed.  These units claim 30% less drag than the towed  line generators.  
Water generator units often advertise that they  can be mounted vertically with a larger propeller  to capture wind power. However the spec sheets  show that this gives poor generating performance  compared to a dedicated, modern wind  generator.

Power Cells: Power  cells are a new  technology to the  
sailing world. Just a  few years ago they shut  
down when tilted, as  
when sailing to  windward, making them  unusable. However this problem has been  corrected. Power cells are now being used by  top racers in Trans-Atlantic and round-the-world  voyages.  
Power cells use a simple chemical reaction to  produce electricity. Methanol mixes with  oxygen passing through a membrane to release  electrons – thus electricity. A simple, quiet  pump is the only mechanical aspect of the  device. The methanol is used up in the process.  The only byproducts are water and carbon  dioxide (the same amount of CO2 as a person  breathing) so the unit can be used in the cabin.  
A typical power cell will produce about 1.1  kilowatt hours per litre of fuel, making it about  24% less efficient than a gas generator. Power  cells often have automatic on/off functions to  ensure the batteries are always charged. This can  lead to problems if used in conjunction with a  solar panel system, so it is recommended that  they be operated manually.  
Power cells are also considerably more  expensive and use more expensive fuel than a  generator. However, the mechanical simplicity,  reliability and low noise make them a good  choice for sailing in well developed areas where  the fuel is readily available. This would not be  advisable for cruising to the far flung tropical  islands of the world.  
Generators: Small, portable gasoline or diesel  generators have a longer history in sailing. They  are more efficient than a fuel cell, producing 1.5 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 12  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

kilowatt hours per litre of fuel for a small model  and gasoline or diesel is readily available  worldwide. As a full, working engine,  generators are mechanically complex with many  parts that can wear or break. Generators produce  dangerous  
carbon  
monoxide so  
must not be  
used inside the  
cabin.  
Generators  
claim to be  
quite, but I  
would not want  
to be sleeping  
next to a  
running unit. Generators are known to have  problems when tilted or in very rough seas. The  oil systems are not able to maintain pressure,  shutting them down.  
Yacht Engine: Using the yacht engine is a  common method  
of generating  
power. Racers  
using generators  
or the yacht  
engine speak of  
running the motor  
for one hour every  
eight hours of  
sailing.  
Personally, I find  
this concept unappealing. If I had wanted a  motor running, I’d have bought a cigarette boat  and forget all about the canvas overhead.  
However, those who do use the yacht engine  have worked out methods of increasing the  efficiency of the charging process. Richard Lett,  sailing Velocity Girl, made these comments  (interspaced with notes from two time  circumnavigator Bruce Schwab):  
Most, almost all stock  
alternators are sourced from the  
automotive industry. They are  designed to recharge a starter  battery after starting and to run  lights etc. whilst the engine is  running. All easy stuff  
requiring no great charging  abilities, just a low constant  power drain. Almost the opposite  of what a yacht needs having run  batteries to 50% so and requiring  as quick a recharge as possible.  
In a car, the engine and  
batteries work together. On a  yacht they work separately. This  is where the voltage comes in;  car alternators don't need high  voltage to push in a charge,  because batteries are always  being charged as the engine is  running. A car battery will only  ever be at around 80% charge  MAXIMUM, because it doesn't  matter and the car alternator  doesn’t have the high voltage  output to fill them any further.  It just doesn't matter to a car.  
Now on a yacht what we want are  batteries as near their potential  capacity as possible. When a  battery is flat any alternator  will do because the resistance to  charge in the battery is low, as  the battery fills the resistance  to filling increases (your 6th  pint never goes down as quick as  the first!). It is the voltage  that provides the push. That is  why overhead power cables run at  really high voltages because the  power (amps) has to be pushed for  many miles around a country or  across a continent.  
So car alternators do not have  the voltage to charges batteries  once they get to around 70%. Why  would a car alternator  
manufacturer go to the expense of  building a high voltage  
alternator when it is not  required by the industry? 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 4 - 13  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Resistance gets really high as  batteries get above 70% or so.  Dedicated charging alternators,  such as Balmar are built with  high voltage regulators to keep  pushing the amps into the  batteries, or you can buy an  after market regulator to improve  the performance of your basic car  type alternator. These still  will not fully charge your  batteries, they will get them to  80% and will charge at a higher  rate for a lot longer than the  car type.  
(Note from Bruce Schwab: Almost any  alternator can output a high  voltage if properly regulated  with an external regulator.  However, the alternator may not  hold up very well under heavy  load and long use. Even the well  known Balmar brand has a  
reputation for overheating and  not putting out their “rated”  amps. There are several brands  that I prefer including Amptech,  Ample Power and American Power.)  
When you read about multi stage  chargers all they are doing is  varying the voltage of the  alternator. They do this when  you have the time and luxury to  charge batteries over many hours,  like leaving on charge in the  garage overnight. They cycle  between high and low voltage to  deal with bulk, trickle and  maintenance phases. When at sea  racing, you don't have time for  all that. What you do is leave  batteries to run all the way  down, whack charge as quick as  you can until batteries get to  around 80% charge, you will see  charge rate drop from around  80amps to around 20 amps. Because  even a high volt alternator  cannot pack charge in quickly to  a nearly full battery that is  seriously resisting being  charged. Quit trying to charge  
once the charge rate drops and  turn the engine off, stop wasting  fuel and making a noise, you are  wasting your efforts.  
Use the battery monitor to tell  when battery voltage has dropped  close to 12v. Start charging.  Watch the battery monitor and see  the charge rate start really high  and drop as the battery fills,  then decide when to stop. For me  charging starts around 90 amps,  once I see the charge rate drop  to around 25 amps, I stop. I  don't even need to check, I just  know the battery is around 80%  full.  
(Note from Bruce Schwab: If you use  your engine as the generator, the  more you can load it up the more  fuel efficient it will be. On  the Open 60 “OceanPlanet” the  29hp engine had a 130A x 24V  alternator (the same as 260A x  12V!). The battery bank was  360Ah x 24V (same as 720Ah x 12V)  of Geltech batteries. With this  system even if there was no sun  for the solar panels, I could get  by on one hour of charging per  day. On good sun days in the  South Atlantic I sometimes went 3  days before needing to charge  with the engine. Having a cutoff  switch for the alternator  regulator (or a “low power” mode)  is essential with such a big  alternator on a small engine.)  
When in marina I leave the boat  charging on a shore powered multi  stage charger, so I start every  voyage with 100% full batteries.  They will never get above 80%  again until back on the shore  charger. Once you know this,  live with it, charge when  necessary, sail for the rest of  the time and enjoy the peace of  knowing you are doing all that is  possible whilst afloat.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Good quality batteries matter,  AGM batteries, for example, can  take most if not all the charge  an alternator can provide.  Cheaper lead acid types can be  damaged if too many amps are  thrown at them, so a powerful  alternator and efficient charging  systems are wasted. So if you  want to keep charge time to a  minimum, a combination of high  amp output and full charge  acceptance is what you want.  
Batteries are one part of  equation. For offshore I suggest  around 300 amps worth - once  unplugged from shore power and  charging from the engine you will  only recharge to around 80%  (technical reasons for this, but  true whatever claims are made  unless you want to run engine for  long periods of time). This means  that you are running between 50%  and 80% of charge which is @100  amps (on a 300 amp bank) at 5 amp  per hour this gives you up to 20  hrs between charges, or two 60amp  top ups per 24 hrs, which is a  fairy relaxed and stress free  schedule.  
The alternator needs to deliver  its amps at high voltage to push  all that power into the battery.  This is where most factory fitted  alternators come up short. They  only deliver their amps at around  13.7 or so Vs so when they sense  resistance from the battery as it  fills up they start to reduce  output, significantly. You can be  running engine (at whatever revs)  and alternator is only giving you  less than 10amps, you may as well  not bother, unless you like the  sound of the engine. The  solution is either one of the  Adverc systems that regulate the  output of your existing  
alternator to more than 14 Vs or  you buy a marine specific  Alternator like the Balmar that  
is designed to charge at higher  volts. The higher the voltage of  the Alternator the more charge  you get in before the alternator  is defeated by the resistance.  
Next like many I have a clever  battery monitor (only they are  not as clever as they think). It  is meant to count all the amps in  and out. But after a few days it  is wrong and not so helpful.  However the good news is the Volt  meter and Amp meter work very  well and can be used as follows.  Run all systems until your Volt  reading is close to 12 V's which  means batteries are low, then run  engine, Alternator will push out  nearly its whole potential and  drop to below 20amps when battery  reaches close to 80% charge, then  you should stop. You may have  added around 60amps in that first  hour, quit, enjoy the peace.  Extra hours waste fuel, don't  provide much extra amps, charging  twice a day for an hour on a low  battery is very economical and  will provide you with around 120  amps per day or an average of 5  amps per hour. For one more  hours charging you can get up to  8 amps per hour, or you can shut  something down. Re the amp  reading on the battery monitor,  you can use it to see when your  alternator performance has fallen  of a cliff and shut the engine  down - this means battery is up  to 80% charge and the last 20%  could take all day, and isn't  worth the effort. It is because  of the last 20% that shore based  chargers (however clever and  however many stages) take all  night to complete the charge.  
Regarding engine speed - most  pulleys are about 2 to 1 ratio,  so double engine speed to know  what alternator is running at.  Between 1000 - 1400 should be  optimal for most.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Regarding belts, any alternator  over 100 amps need 2 V belts or a  one of the newer serpentine  belts. 2 belts are never quite  the same length and can be a real  problem to set up. The new  serpentine belts don't slip and  can handle huge outputs. I had  new pulleys made for engine and  alternator at J Class Marine  (Shamrock) for £80. And they  work a treat.  
(Roy Hadland made this comment:  As a marine engineer I often use  pulleys with two, three or even  four belts. We specify that they  must be matched when we place  the order. The company will  ship matched belts that are  exactly the same length. Any  local store should be able to do  the same if asked.)  
Regarding smart chargers for  engine - don't waste your money -  OK if you are cruising and only  have engine to charge batteries,  you can leave engine on all  evening, night or day to handle  the full battery charge; if  racing - just go for the hour  charge on a low battery, accept  you are running on 80% until you  get back home - to charge quickly  you only need good batteries, a  high Voltage Alternator and  patience to wait until batteries  are low to run the engine.  
I run a Balmar 120 alternator,  which still only provides 95 amps  to a flat battery in the real  world, but it does top it up very  quick - as an aside at that  output it gets very hot - to keep  everything happy make sure engine  bay is well ventilated to  dissipate heat - also you need to  start engine at 1400 or so revs,  as when the alternator kicks in  after a minute or so of starting,  if you are on tick over it may  stall your engine! I have fitted  
a switch to disable alternator if  I need full engine power at any  time, they 120 amp can draw up to  20% from my 20 HP Lombardini.  
My initial premise with this section was that the  best method of managing power is to reduce  power requirements. After this, solar panels  should be the primary method of generating  power because of simplicity and reliability.  They offer the greatest benefit with none of the  disadvantages of mechanical systems. I will  stick with these ideas and leave it up to the  skipper to select a secondary source of power, if  one is necessary at all.

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Ch. 5: Self Steering Systems  
Shock Cord sailing –for every singlehander:  
I put this first because it is vital for every  singlehander, and if I left it until last most  readers would just skim over it and not learn  these techniques. This information is important  because it is guaranteed that at some point the  autopilot will fail or the windvane will break.  Neither of these pitfalls is an excuse to stop  sailing. I find it ridiculous that a significant  voyage (such as a major Trans Atlantic race  costing hundreds of thousands of dollars)  would be halted because of autopilot failure or  wind vane breakage. These techniques work  perfectly well, are virtually idiot proof and  only require five dollars worth of materials.  
As a second consideration, many crewed boat  racing rules insist that boats not use any type  of autopilot or windvane. Hand steering a boat  by the compass at three in the morning is  extremely difficult, even on a fully crewed  boat. The techniques described below would  not contravene any racing rules because they  work solely by making use of the wind on the  sails and nothing more.  
Although these techniques were developed  many years ago for full keel boats, I have  tested them and found that they work perfectly  well on modern, fin-keel boats. My Olson 30  is considered to be especially twitchy. If the  techniques work on my boat, they are likely to  work most anywhere else.  
I have placed a video of these techniques up  on Youtube.com. Search for “Foolish Muse  self steering” or go to:  
http://tinyurl.com/4tfr2ah  
Upwind steering: Beating into the wind is the  easiest. Simply by lashing the tiller in place  and making some minor adjustments to sail  trim, the boat will continue on its course with  only slight variation. It is amusing that in  
most races, the singlehander will be eating on  upwind legs when the boat can steer itself,  while crewed boats eat on downwind legs  when the boat is flat.  
I recommend against purchasing the store bought tiller locking devices. They are  certainly more expensive and they do not work  nearly as well as my own tiller line that takes  about 5 minutes to create.  
Tiller Line System – for Beating  
This quick “tiller line” method is appropriate  for short term use when beating into the wind,  but will fail in a significant wind shift or  change in wind speed. The approach is taking  a length of line about 3’ shorter than the beam  of the boat at tiller point. Add 1’ of surgical  tubing or shock cord to each end of the line.  Surgical tubing is considered better than shock  cord because it stretches more consistently as  it is extended out. Then add some sort of hook  or carabiner at each end. Attach this to the toe  rail or a cleat on each side of the boat, about 1’  back from the tip of the tiller. It should take a  little tension to wrap the line one time around  the tiller and more tension to wrap the cord  around the tiller twice.  
To use this device, sail the boat by hand until  it is beating perfectly into the wind. The sails  should be trimmed perfectly with the telltales  flying. Wrap the tiller line one time around  
the tip of the tiller. (Two times in higher  winds or even three times in very high wind if  necessary.) The tiller line should have enough  grip to hold the tiller without slipping. Make  sure that the tiller line is holding the tiller  exactly in the same position as hand steering.  This will take some adjustment because the  stretch of the tubing will let the tiller drop.  The beauty of using a stretchy tiller line is that 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 1  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

it allows for small adjustments by pulling on  the line, without removing it from the tiller.  
Let go of the tiller and watch. Most likely the  boat will round up slowly. When hand  steering, there is a normal tendency to have  more weather helm than necessary, even if the  skipper has read my previous advice about  eliminating pressure on the helm. When the  boat rounds up, ease the mainsheet slightly -  just an inch at a time. It is the mainsail that is  pulling the boat up. As the mainsheet is eased,  at some point the tiller line will do its job and  the boat will sail perfectly on its own.  
This system works because the tiller, held  slightly to windward, is trying to steer the boat  down. Every time the boat sails down, the  mainsail catches the wind and tries to pull the  boat back up again. When the boat heads up  the mainsail will luff and will stop pulling the  boat upwards and the tiller will steer the boat  down again. The boat will be sailing an  elongated S shape through the water, sailing  up and down again. With just a bit of  adjustment this S shape will be eliminated and  the boat will be sailing perfectly straight. A  variation of 5° on either side of straight would  be very well done. The singlehander should  make tiny adjustments to jib and mainsail trim  and tiller position until the perfect combination  is achieved.  
The important part of this technique is DO  NOT tighten the main sheet when the sail  luffs. It is normal when hand steering to  tighten the main sheet when the mainsail luffs.  This would be a very standard reaction. But  when using the tiller line, if the skipper  tightens the main sheet, he will be pulling the  boat up past the point where the tiller line has  control. He will be pulling the boat up past its  normal beating position. The skipper must let  the mainsail luff until the boat falls down  again and the mainsail catches. It requires self  control to allow the mainsail to luff, but it is  important.  
The tiller line system works best in consistent,  moderate winds. When using the tiller line, as  with hand steering, changes to the tiller  position will be required with changes in wind  strength. The tiller must be pulled to  windward as winds increase and dropped to  leeward as winds drop. Otherwise the boat  will quickly sail off in the wrong direction.  Such changes are easily done by slipping the  tiller line’s position over the tiller.  
Long Line System – for Running  
While the singlehander is hand steering  downwind, it is even possible to gybe a  spinnaker by running long lines from the tiller,  to turning blocks on the toe rail on each side of  the boat, up to the foredeck. In moderate  winds, the skipper will be able to walk to the  foredeck and gybe the chute. Any steering  adjustments are made simply by grabbing the  “long lines” on the foredeck. To do this the  skipper must pay close attention to the boat  direction as it can change very quickly. This  means less concentration on the gybe actions.  This will not work in high winds where the  boat can round up in an instant.  
Storm Jib System  
The tiller line system described above only  works when beating into the wind. On a reach  the boat would just round up, so a more  elaborate system is needed. The “storm jib”  system will work from beating close hauled to  a broad reach of around 120º true. It will work  past this point but becomes less reliable.  Additionally, the storm jib system is a long  term solution. It can be used for hours or days  on end in any conditions. Singlehander Tony  Skidmore used this method as his sole means  of self steering on a 17,000 mile voyage in a  24 foot sloop.  
The storm jib system only requires a few feet  of surgical tubing, a storm jib (or stay sail) and  two snatch blocks. The normal jib/genoa and  mainsail are used to drive the boat at speed.

The following steps must all be completed for  the system to work, but I have included them  in this order only for clarity. It will take 5  minutes to set up the boat to use this method.  During this setup time, use the simple “tiller  line” steering method to beat into the wind.  After setting up, lay-off to a beam reach for  the best use of the “storm jib” system.  
Tie 3’ of surgical tubing into a loop and attach  a short line. Run this line through a turning  block on the leeward side of the boat even  with the tip of the tiller and around the leeward  winch. Slip the surgical tubing over the tip of  the tiller. It should be tight enough that it pulls  strongly on the tiller. The line on the winch is  used to adjust the tension of the tubing.  
Take a storm jib or stay sail and attach the tack  to the toe rail or bow cleat on the windward side of the boat, just a foot or two back from  the bow. Use a spinnaker halyard to raise the  storm jib tight. Run a small line, such as a  spinnaker sheet, from the clew of the storm jib  to a block on the windward toe rail near the  shrouds. Run the sheet back through another  block on the windward toe rail even with the  tip of the tiller. Pull tight on the sheet and  wrap it around the tiller just in front of the  surgical tubing. I find that wrapping the sheet  over itself two or three times will hold it in  place securely. The tension on the sheet on the  windward side of the boat should offset the  tension of the tubing on the leeward side.  
The storm jib will be parallel with the boat  centre. As the boat sails downwards, wind  pressure on the storm jib is reduced and the  
surgical tubing pulls the tiller down, bringing  the boat back up. As the boat sails up, wind  pressure on the storm jib increases, and the  sheet pulls the tiller up, sailing the boat back  down again. Use the line from the tubing to  the winch to adjust the tension of the tubing.  Use the sheet and the forward block position to  adjust the tension of the storm jib.  
On the first attempt, pull on the tiller and ease  the main sheet and jib sheet to drop to a beam  reach. IMPORTANT: The storm jib is only  used to keep the boat sailing in a straight line.  It is the jib and mainsail that determine the  direction of the boat. Thus the jib and main  must be properly trimmed for a beam reach.  The storm jib will not override the basic sail  trim. On the first attempt, ease the jib sheet  and main sheet well past the normal sailing  position. Tighten them slowly until the boat  starts to head up. Then ease them again. With  small adjustments the boat can be steered with  amazing accuracy.  
To change course, under normal conditions it  is not necessary to adjust the storm jib or the  tubing. The boat direction will change simply  by adjusting the sail trim in or out. Pull the  sails nearly all the way in to head up to a close  reach. Ease the sails out to lay-off to a broad  reach. I have found this method works well  down to 120º true. At 130º true the system  will still work, but the boat will swing through  wider variation.  
The storm jib and tubing tension will require  adjustment if there is a significant change in  wind strength. Under high winds two loops of  surgical tubing can be used to increase tension.  
The storm jib method works amazingly well in  all conditions and will hold a course better  than most human drivers. It does not require  any power and certainly does not have the  noise of an autopilot. Even those boats with  the most advanced electronic systems should  consider using the storm jib method in open  water.  
Downwind – Poled Out Jib System The “storm jib” system will operate effectively  down to a broad reach. After this point, we  move to the “poled out jib” system. This will  operate all the way down to a dead run at 180º  but it is most effective at 145º.

This method will only work sailing downwind  with a genoa, not with a spinnaker. A poled  out jib (or poled out storm jib in high winds) is  used the steer the boat.  
Setup in the cockpit is the same as the  previous system. The surgical tubing and  tension line is setup exactly the same on the  leeward side of the boat, although it may  require more tension.  
A jib is raised on the forestay along with the  genoa. The genoa will be on the leeward side  and the jib on the windward side of the boat.  The skipper must interweave the sail hanks to  ensure that both sails are raised to their full  tension. It is probable that the jib is shorter  than the genoa so two halyards will be needed  to raise both sails simultaneously.  
The spinnaker pole or whisker pole is used to  pole the jib out very far forward on the  windward side of the boat. The pole will only  be a foot or two back from the forestay and the  jib will fly well in front of the boat.  
A sheet is run from the clew of the jib back to  a snatch block (or spinnaker sheet block) on  the toe rail on the windward side, even with  the tip of the tiller. The sheet is wrapped  around the tip of the tiller, in front of the  tubing. Even in moderate winds, the sheet will  be under significant tension. It will require  strength to wrap it around the tiller and the  surgical tubing must have sufficient tension to  hold the tiller in the centre of the boat. Under  high winds two loops of surgical tubing can be  used to increase tension.  
In use, as the boat heads up the poled out jib  catches more wind, pulling the tiller to  windward and heading the boat down. As the  boat drops down, the poled out jib sheds wind,  allowing the tubing to pull the tiller down and  head the boat up again.  
Of course the sails must be properly trimmed  for the desired heading. However, with this  
system the poled out jib is used to adjust the  boat heading. If the pole is pulled back about  3’ from the forestay, the boat will drop down  to sail between 170º and 180º. In this case the  genoa will be completely blanketed by the  mainsail so the boat could be sailed with no  genoa at all. As the boat nears 180º, the poled  out jib will collapse allowing the boat to head  up.  
If the pole is eased to about 1’ from the  forestay, the boat will head up to sail between  135º and 145º. In this case the genoa will fill  and the boat will sail at optimum speed.  The entire range of control of the poled out jib  is very small, about three feet in total. Very  small adjustments to the jib sheet will change  the heading.  
In light to moderate winds it is best to use a  poled out jib. In strong winds a poled out  storm jib should be used. I have found it is  unwise to use a storm jib in light or moderate  winds. The reason is that the storm jib must be  stretched out completely to have the desired  effect on steering. Having it completely  stretched out will allow it to continue to have  pull even if the boat is at 180º, risking an  accidental gybe.  
Sheet to Tiller systems: Other methods of  self steering have been developed using either  the jib or the main as the force for the steering  power, rather than a storm jib as described  above, with the same surgical tubing on the  opposite side. These systems require a few  more blocks and lines, but not a storm jib. In  one such system, a line is connected to the  mainsheet midway between the traveler and  the boom, run out to a block on the toe rail and  back to the tiller, with surgical tubing to  provide opposing force. An excellent  description with photographs is provided on  “Augustine – A Pearson Ariel Page” located at  http://solopublications.com/sailariq.htm

The benefit of this system is that the skipper  need not shift a storm jib from side to side  with each tack. The disadvantage of the  systems is that the large sails are very  powerful and must be carefully balanced.  
For greatest efficiency, any self steering  system should not require either the jib or  main to luff in order for the boat to fall back  into the wind. Obviously allowing a sail to luff  slows the boat down considerably. The benefit  of the storm jib systems is that the storm jib,  used only for steering, luffs. This does not  slow the boat.  
Autopilot or Wind Vane (Note that I use the  generic term “autopilot” because the often  used term “autohelm” is a trademark of  Raymarine)  
This is a longstanding debate among  singlehanders. But in reality, the choice has  already been made; it is just up to the skipper  to determine what type of sailing he will do  and what type of boat he will do it on. Then  the choice becomes obvious.  
Personally, I have a preference for an  electronic autopilot system, for several  reasons:  
Although I dream of long ocean passages, in  reality 51 weeks a year my sailing is made up  
of 3-5 hour trips within 20 miles of my home  club. This leads to maneuvering in relatively  tight waters, i.e. leaving the harbor and raising  the sail under motor power, tacking out of the  bay and up the strait, returning home and  gybing down the strait with all of the  maneuvers reversed, dropping the sails and  returning to my slip. Each of these steps  requires precise boat control and steering. I  estimate that on a typical fun sail, I would  adjust the autopilot 30-40 times, even more  during a race. An autopilot is ideal for this  type of day-to-day sailing. It activates  immediately, adjusts with the push of a button  and provides rapid response. A windvane can  not offer this level of flexibility.  
However, for long passages, the windvane can  easily become the preferred solution. For  example, once into open water on a large lake  or wide strait, it may be three hours between  tacks. On the open ocean it may actually be  several days between course changes. In these  cases the immediate flexibility of the autopilot  is overwhelmed by the mechanical simplicity  and directional reliability of the windvane.  Losing a minute or two during a tack is  unimportant if only done a few times each day.  If heading in one particular wind direction for  several hours at a time, a windvane can hold  that direction very accurately without limit,  with no power draw or noise. An autopilot has  a constant power draw and the unremitting  hum becomes extremely annoying. The  singlehander will learn to despise the sound of  his autopilot below decks. After several days  it can lead to insanity.  
The decision process is also influenced by the  type of boat being sailed. I sail on an  “ultralight” that will surf very easily with the  wind. In these situations the boat takes off  down a wave at nearly the same speed as the  wind. To operate, a windvane must have a  reasonable apparent wind passing over the  boat. If my boat starts to surf, there is virtually  no apparent wind and the windvane will lose 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 7  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

its grip. This is the reason why modern, ocean  going racing boats always use an electronic  autopilot. They all surf and a windvane  simply will not work.  
On the other hand, a heavy cruising boat will  rarely pick up and surf down a wave. It will  always have apparent wind, regardless of the  
point of sail. A windvane will be effective all  the time.  
As a further consideration, autopilots are rated  depending on the weight of the boat. If  conditions are very rough and winds are very  strong, an autopilot will be overtaxed in  steering a heavy boat. A windvane is set up  for the size of the boat and simply does not  consider displacement as a factor.  
Thus the choice between autopilot and  windvane is already made for the  
singlehander. It depends solely on the type of  boat and the type of sailing to be done. If the  majority of sailing is active maneuvering  within a few hours of the home port, an  autopilot is by far the better choice. If  planning a long ocean voyage, the autopilot is  preferable only for light racing boats. The  windvane is the choice for cruising yachts.  Most long distance sailors do not make a  choice –they take both a wind vane and  autopilot. The autopilot is used when  motoring and in light down wind or beam  reach conditions. It is also useful during sail  changes, tacking or gybing. Otherwise, the  wind vane silently does all the work.  
Tony Gooch is one of my great heroes. In  2002, Tony left the Royal Victoria Yacht Club  on a solo, non-stop circumnavigation. During  his trip he did an in-depth comparison between  windvane and autopilot. Below is an article  written by Tony and published in Cruising  World Magazine in January 2004.  
Albert Takes on Otto 
Offshore Sailing by Tony Gooch.  
In 1995, my wife, Coryn, and I  sold the Arpège 29 we'd sailed  for 16 years, during which time  we'd crossed the Atlantic and  Pacific oceans. In her place,  we bought a 42-foot German built aluminum sloop, named her  Taonui, and proceeded to log  more thousands of miles. Then  in September 2002, I set off on  my attempt to sail solo, non stop around the world, starting  and finishing in British  Columbia. On that voyage,  which I intended to complete as  quickly as I prudently could, I  planned to make extensive use  of an autopilot.  
Based on my experience two  years earlier on a solo voyage  from Cape Town, South Africa,  to England via Cape Horn, I  felt that a good, powerful  autopilot would do a better job  than a windvane, particularly  when running before the  
westerlies in the Southern  Ocean. With this in mind, I  upgraded Taonui's Simrad  autopilot drive unit to the  manufacturer's HDL2000L model.  To drive it, I installed the  latest Simrad. AP22 and J300X  control units, and I also added  the necessary electronics to  enable the AP22 to steer a  course relative to a chosen  apparent-wind direction.  
When we bought Taonui, she had  a Monitor windvane that had  already seen 30,000 sea miles.  Taonui has a long keel, a keel hung rudder, and tiller  steering, and this windvane,  which we affectionately called  Albert, did a fine job of  keeping a steady course in all  manner of seas and winds. I

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

have a great regard for Albert,  but without wanting to seem  disloyal after many thousands  of miles, I felt that the  upgraded Simrad autopilot,  nicknamed Otto, achieved longer  daily runs.  
The force of wave action on the  hull and changes in the  
apparent wind will cause a  windvane to steer a course that  weaves from side-to-side. In  theory, because it's set to  follow a chosen compass  
heading, an autopilot steers a  dead-straight course. I even  installed a new RFC 35 fluxgate  compass that would give the  control unit more accurate  information. In fact, of  course, the actual track  steered by the autopilot also  weaves from side-to-side. A  soft key on the new Simrad  control unit allows you to view  the actual course (as distinct  from the chosen course), and I  was surprised at the amount of  yawing it displayed. In the  early days of singlehanded  ocean racing, the boats were  steered by windvanes, but as  the yachts became longer and  faster and able to accelerate  more quickly, the changes in  the apparent wind became too  rapid for a windvane to handle.  Today, these racing machines  regularly hit sustained speeds  of 20 to 30 knots and need  sophisticated  
electric/hydraulic autopilots  acting directly on their  rudderstocks.  
Taonui is 42 feet long and  displaces about 15 tons, fully loaded with her full bilges and  deep, long keel, she's a very  comfortable offshore cruiser,  and Albert can certainly handle  any speeds she's likely to  achieve, even "surfing"  
downwind in a Southern Ocean  
gale. Albert follows the  apparent wind. If I set the  sails for maximum speed for the  wind that's blowing, Albert  will keep Taonui sailing at her  fastest speed for that wind.  The wind rarely blows steadily  from exactly the same  
direction; it always oscillates  five to 10 degrees, and of  course, it's subject to actual  shifts in direction. None of  which troubles Albert. Otto  follows a chosen compass  heading. He doesn't know about  wind shifts, and when they do  occur, the boat will be sailing  at less than its maximum speed.  I felt that when wind  
oscillations are small, these  probably wouldn't have a big  effect, but a 10-degree wind  shift would certainly result in  a loss of speed, which, if I  were asleep, would go unnoticed  until the change in the boat's  motion woke me.  
Under the influence of the wind  and waves, both Albert and Otto  deviate from side to side of  the desired or, in Otto's case,  the selected course. Albert's  deviations are wider, but he  delivers a higher speed. The  objective when passage making  is to maximize the number of  miles made good toward a  selected point.  
So which system is better?  
The Contest  
On a six-month nonstop  
circumnavigation, I had plenty  of time and opportunity to  compare the performances of the  two steering systems. I ran  tests in which I would set  Taonui on a steady course  relative to the wind, with  first the windvane (Albert)  steering for an hour, then with 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 9  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

Otto the autopilot at the helm  for an hour.  
If the wind strength or  
direction changed, I abandoned  the test and started again. I  wanted to see which steering  system yielded the most miles  made good in an hour in as near  as possible the same wind and  sea conditions. If the wind was  between 38 and 85 degrees  apparent, I set the autopilot  to steer a course relative to  the apparent wind. The  
autopilot can't steer off the  readout of the apparent wind if  it's aft of the beam, so with  the apparent wind between 90  and 180 degrees, I had the  autopilot steer a compass  course. I tracked Taonui's  performance by GPS, and to get  a readout of miles made good to  two decimal places, I set a  course to a waypoint that was  less than 100 miles away.  Before I started the clock  running, I would trim the sails  for maximum speed, then not  touch them for the two hours of  the test.  
Observations  
Although the autopilot steers a  straighter course, in most of  the tests, the windvane yielded  more miles made good. The  windvane reads the small  oscillations in the apparent  wind and adjusts the course to  keep the sails driving at  maximum efficiency. With the  wind aft of the beam, the  autopilot tries to steer a  compass course, and the changes  in the apparent wind result in  the sails performing at less  than maximum efficiency. The  differences are small, but over  a long passage, they do add up:  If my average speed for the  circumnavigation had been 5- percent slower, I would have  
taken 186 days instead of the  actual 177 days.  
With the wind forward of the  beam and the autopilot steering  to a set apparent-wind angle,  there wasn't much to choose  between the autopilot and the  windvane, though it was clear  that the windvane yielded more  miles made good at the smaller  apparent-wind angles. If the  wind was between 85 and 95  degrees apparent, it was better  to set the autopilot on a fixed  compass course, and with this,  the autopilot yielded more  miles made good than the  windvane.  
I also ran a number of tests,  which aren't recorded here, in  which I sailed on a close reach  and close-hauled with Otto  steering a compass course. The  autopilot's inability to "read"  the wind reduced the speed and  miles made good, when compared  to those achieved by the  windvane, by about a third. The  reason for this is that a  windvane acts like a helmsman  and keeps the sails performing  at maximum efficiency by  following the wind as it  oscillates and/or as the boat  rides up and over the waves.  The autopilot tries to force a  fixed course, and the sails are  inevitably luffing or over  trimmed relative to the  
changing wind.  
Bottom Line  
Boats up to about 30 feet can  be steered by an autopilot that  connects directly to the  tiller, and some models of  light-performance autopilots  can be connected to the hub of  a steering wheel. These units  are adequate for motoring, but  they’re not strong enough for 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 10  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

extensive use offshore. Ocean going boats longer than 30 or  32 feet will typically have an  electric or hydraulic linear drive ram connected to the  rudderstock below decks. This  requires fitting a strong  mounting base, running  
electrical cables, and mounting  control units cost of Taonui's  upgraded Simrad system was  $4,300, not including taxes.  Installation cost only $450  because the mounting place was  built when the boat was  
constructed and we could use  much of the old wiring. To  fabricate and install a  
mounting base, run wiring, and  fit the autopilot components  would take 25 to 30 man-hours  and cost roughly $1,500 to  $2,000, for a total cost of  around $6,000. By contrast, a  new Monitor windvane costs  $3,500 to $3,800, depending on  whether the boat has wheel or  tiller steering, you can fit it  on the stern of almost any  sailboat, and it's a do-it yourself installation. An  autopilot draws a current of 3  to 5 amps, which on most boats  is generated by the engine driven alternator. Most  windvanes are reasonably  bulletproof in construction,  but if something does fail,  they're relatively easy to  repair. The sacrificial tube  between the pendulum strut and  the water vane is designed to  break in the event of a  
collision or excessive load.  It’s easy to replace.  
I had only one such breakage on  this trip. During 110,000 miles  of sailing, Albert's only other  breakages were; a worn out  
bushing, a compression fitting  on the actuator shaft, which as  an easy fix on a drill press  and the loss of the water vane.  Before my first  
circumnavigation, I replaced  the pendulum and every three or  four years I've replaced the  turning blocks for the control  lines. In contrast, a couple of  years ago, a hydraulic seal  broke on my old Simrad, and I  had to return it to the factory  for repair. Since then, I've  carried a spare drive unit  (costing $2,150). An  
autopilot's electronic control  units are usually trouble free,  but if they do fail, they're  black boxes. Aesthetically, a  windvane is more pleasing. It  makes no noise, requires no  feeding, and works in harmony  with the wind and the waves. An  autopilot makes a noise,  requires the running of an  engine or generator to supply  its energy, and uses force to  overcome the pressure of the  wind and the waves. Based on  the tests I ran, a windvane  delivers more miles made good.  On a long passage, this is what  it's all about.  
Having said all this, I would  always carry both an autopilot  and a windvane, if for no other  reason than an autopilot is  needed when motoring. For  shorthanded sailing, it's  essential to have two  
independent self-steering  systems in case one fails. But,  if I could have only one, I'd  choose a windvane for offshore  passage making.  
Using a wind vane 
A wind vane is really only useful in ocean  sailing where you expect to be on the same  point of sail for hours or days. A wind vane  should be thought of as a device to hold a  course relative to the wind, rather than as  means of steering the boat or of changing  course, so it is not used for tacking or gybing.  Before the wind vane is engaged the boat

Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

should be set on the desired course relative to  the wind and the sails should be set so the boat  is balanced and will steer itself with only a  little pressure on the tiller. The most common  mistake in using a wind vane is carrying too  much mainsail which causes the boat to round  up into the wind. 
Section 4 of the Manual for the Monitor Self steering System sets out the best practices for  using a wind vane on various points of sail.  This excellent manual can be downloaded at  http://www.selfsteer.com/pdfs/MonitorManual .pdf  
A wind vane works best and will out perform  an autopilot when sailing with the wind  forward of the mast in any wind strength. On a  beam reach an autopilot will outperform a  wind vane especially in light winds. In heavy  winds 20 + knots, a wind vane will outperform  an autopilot on a beam reach. In light winds aft  of the mast an autopilot yields higher speed  and distance made good. As the wind  strengthens above 12 knots true the wind vane  is superior. Of course, if the wind shifts the  wind vane follows the wind and speed is  maintained. Under autopilot the boat stays on a  constant compass course (unless driven by a  wind direction sensor) and the boat speed  drops.  
Using a windvane small (say 5 degree) course  changes can be made by changing the angle of  the vane and the set of the sails. For greater  course changes it is best to disengage the vane  from the tiller, steer the boat onto the new  course, adjust the sails as needed, make sure  that the boat is balanced and that there is little  pressure needed on the tiller to maintain  course, then set the angle of the windvane so  that it vertical and then re-connect the lines  from the windvane to the tiller. After this  watch the boat's performance and make small  adjustments as needed. To emphasize an  earlier comment, a windvane can't be used to  steer the boat, i.e. change course. It is a device  
to maintain a chosen course relative to the  wind.  
Autopilots:  
There are several well known manufacturers of  autopilot systems. Some are more prevalent in  Europe and some in North America and they  range in price. I will not attempt to compare  the systems. However I will make these  general statements which should be held as  gospel truth.  
First, every system will break. There is no  question about this. So, just as important as  the initial purchase is the location of repair  service. I am especially lucky that the  Raymarine service centre is exactly half way  between my home and my office – and I walk  to work! A singlehander will not be  interested in waiting three or four weeks for  service when his autopilot breaks during  racing season. A two day turnaround is  invaluable. Before a purchase is made,  carefully search through the manufacturers’  web site to find a local service centre. A quick  phone call will confirm whether service is  actually performed on site or if they are going  to ship it off to the other side of the world. I  also know from experience that it is a good  idea to develop a personal relationship with  the repair technician. It is nice if he knows  you well enough to hand over a completely  new unit rather than wait while he is busy  working on commercial systems costing many  times the price of a small boat autopilot.  
Second, every system will communicate with  common instruments from other manufacturers  via a common protocol such as NMEA. While  this is true, it is significantly less than optimal.  This will be noticed when the autopilot does  not react as quickly as expected with a wind  shift or when a cross wave swings the boat  around. Each manufacturer has developed  their own communications protocol and each  system works best within itself. I recommend 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 12  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

against mixing instruments from different  manufacturers.  
Third, every system proudly advertises its  “hard over time”, i.e. the time it takes for the  ram to move from inner to outer limit. This is  a useless criteria. I don’t care how fast the  ram will move. Other than while tacking, an  autopilot will never need to move more than a  few inches during even the worst wave  conditions. Infinitely more important is that it  move intelligently. There is nothing more  frustrating than watching the tiller stuck in the  wrong position, and waiting for the autopilot  to figure out what to do. Before making a  purchase, current users should be questioned  about how an autopilot reacts during a  broaching situation, how long it takes to settle  on a new tack, how it sets a course when  activated, etc.  
Fourth, no system will work perfectly right out  of the box. It can take many hours of testing  and adjustment to refine the reactions of the  autopilot to the boat and water conditions. All  systems have a level of intelligence that  “learns” the conditions, but significant changes  must be dialed in by the skipper before the  learning can occur.  
Fifth: Other electronics can impact the auto  pilot or vice versa. It is well known that a  Single Side Band radio uses a tremendous  amount of power when transmitting. Even  VHF radios use significant power. It is  important that any radio wires be kept well  away from auto pilot wires. They should be  run on opposite sides of the boat as much as  possible. This interference can run in both  directions; with the auto pilot disturbing the  radio, or the radio disturbing the auto pilot. I  have even seen instances where the auto pilot  only interfered with the radio on one  frequency band.  
Sixth, sail-trim, sail-trim, sail-trim. Nothing is  more important. No autopilot can override  
poor sail trim. Even a small adjustment to trim  will have a significant impact on pilot  operation, especially with the spinnaker where  things can go bad very quickly.  
Tacking and Gybing using an autopilot:  
Personally, I find that tacking with the  autopilot is much slower and less accurate than  tacking manually, using my knees to control  the tiller while I sheet in. As well, I pause half  way through a tack to pull the jib sheet back  (as described in the chapter on Sailing  Techniques). And even further I find that the  autopilot does not settle on the new tack as  quickly as I would like. During a tack the  autopilot swings the boat over 90º. I find that  it can not do this as accurately as I would like.  For these reasons, I do not use the autopilot to  tack. I can do it much better myself.  However, I know several singlehanders who  do use their autopilots to tack very  
successfully. It is up to each skipper to make  his own decision on this.  
I do use the autopilot to gybe. In this case the  boat swing is only 30º or 40º and the pilot has  no trouble handling this correction. (The  gybing process is described in the chapter on  Sailing Techniques.)  
Remote Control:  
A remote control is invaluable on long  voyages. It enables the skipper to move about  the boat to enjoy the sunshine at the bow, or to  sleep below while retaining control of the  autopilot. A particular annoyance is sleeping  during shifty winds. The wind shift alarm will  sound every time the wind changes by 15º. A  remote transmitter will allow the skipper to  react just by lifting his arm, not getting out of  the bunk.  
The remote transmitter also has a safety  aspect. Most autopilot systems will turn the  boat into the wind or through the wind if the 

Andrew Evans on Foolish Muse  Chapter 5 - 13  
Thoughts, Tips, Techniques and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing  

skipper falls overboard while wearing the  remote. Of course it would be incredibly  stupid to rely on this instead of wearing a  harness. In a heavy sea, a boat that heaves-too  
30 metres away might as well be 30 miles  away.  
But, remotes also have significant drawbacks  and must be researched. There are two  problems that commonly arise. First, is the  radio range longer than the boat, or will a walk  to the bow trigger the man-overboard safety  protocols? Second, will weak batteries, or  turning the remote off to replace batteries, also  trigger the man-overboard protocols? The  wireless receiver for the remote must be  mounted near the centre of the boat and away  from significant metal objects like an engine.  Third, remotes don’t like to be immersed in  water. If one does get drenched and becomes  inoperable it may be possible to take it apart,  rinse it in fresh water and dry it with the heat  of the engine. This method worked when the  remote on Rain Drop sat submerged in a  cockpit full of water for two minutes.  
There are many debates about who makes the  “best” autopilot. Based on my observations,  there is no clear cut winner. I have seen bitter  complaints made about every system. Without  making any judgments, here are the major  manufacturers of autopilots:  
• Raymarine, Based in the U.S. and popular  in North America (raymarine.com)  
• Navico, The world’s largest marine  electronics company, which owns B&G  and Simrad. (navico.com)  
o B&G, Based in the U.K. and  
popular in Europe. (bandg.com)  
o Simrad, (Simrad-yachting.com)  • NKE, Based in France and very popular in  Europe. (nke-marine-electronics.com)  • Garmin, based in the U.S. Relatively new  to the auto pilot market. (Garmin.com)  • Coursemaster, Based in Australia  (coursemaster.com)  
Wind Vanes:  
Wind vane steering systems are also  manufactured by several companies. In  making a purchase the key issue is that they  unit be built to  
manage the size  
and weight of the  
boat. Wind vanes  
will obviously not  
face the electronic  
failures of  
autopilots, but they  
are still subject to  
breakage. Luckily,  
most units are built  
so that key  
breakable parts are  
simple to replace while underway. Experience  has shown which parts are most likely to break  and singlehanders are advised to carry several  spares.  
With wind vanes, one only hears of  catastrophic failures under the most severe  conditions where the boat has rolled or another  component, such as the boom, mast or a large  solar panel, has dropped on the wind vane.  
Note that the components of a wind vane can  also form the basis of an emergency rudder  system. Most races will accept a wind vane to  meet emergency rudder requirements.  
Scanmar has an off the shelf attachment for  their Monitor wind vane. The “M•RUD”  essentially attaches a small, spare rudder to the  regular wind vane mounting tubes that are  already installed on the boat. Robin Davie  used this system to sail some 2,300 miles in  the Around Alone. It can be used to steer by  hand, with the wind vane itself or with an auto  pilot. The emergency rudder is smaller than  would be required to steer the boat  
aggressively so it might be necessary to reduce  sail, but it will get the skipper back to port. It
